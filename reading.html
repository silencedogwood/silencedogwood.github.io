<strong>Learning from Harry.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Modelling others.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“When we look at others we see personality traits that explain their behavior, but when we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our behavior… the fundamental attribution error is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits what would be better explained by circumstance and context.” - p30
</p>
<p>
“Well, yes,” Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn’t feeling angrier at Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to be overriding that, for now. “The more you try to justify yourself to people like that, the more it acknowledges that they have the right to question you. It shows you think they get to be your inquisitor, and once you grant someone that sort of power over you, they just push more and more.” This was one of Draco Malfoy’s lessons which Harry had thought was actually pretty smart: people who tried to defend themselves got questioned over every little point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if you made it clear from the start that you were a celebrity and above social conventions, people’s minds wouldn’t bother tracking most violations. “That’s why when Ron came over to me as I was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay away from you, I held my hand out over the floor and said, ‘You see how high I’m holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this high to talk to me.’ Then he accused me of, quote, sucking you into the darkness, unquote, so I pursed my lips and went schluuuuurp, and after that his mouth was still making those talking noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don’t think he’ll be trying his lectures on me again.” - Ch 48 idk what page
</p>
<p>
“Your brain, by sheer Pavlovian association, links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic criminals with unbelievable excuses. You don’t have to consider the specific details, your brain just pattern-matches the hypothesis into a bucket of things you don’t believe, and you’re done… Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory Charms is <em>low-status</em>.” -p1291
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Philip Tetlock’s experiments on people asked to trade off a sacred value for a secular one, like a hospital administrator who has to choose between spending a million dollars on a liver to save a five-year-old, and spending the million dollars to buy other hospital equipment or pay physician salaries. And the subjects became indignant and wanted to punish the administrator for even thinking about the choice… you thought that was stupid, since if hospital equipment and doctor salaries didn’t also save lives, there would be no point in having hospitals or doctors.” -p1337
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“Believing men would act in their own interest was not cynicism, it turned out, but sheerest optimism; in reality men do not meet so high a standard.” - p1369
</p>
<p>
“Somewhere in his mind he was moving through an empty room filled with mechanical puppies by whose meaningless lip-moving noises he’d been <em>distracted</em> -” - p1483
</p>
<p>
“That’s not how responsibility works, Professor… when you do fault analysis, there’s no point in assigning fault to a part you can’t change afterward, it’s like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn’t going to change next time. There’s no point in allocating responsibility to people who aren’t going to alter their actions. You realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you’re the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there. That’s why Dumbledore has his room full of broken wands.” - 1503
</p>
<p>
“Not that I should’ve tried asking for help from normal people, of couse, and I will change and be less stupid next time.” - p1504
</p>
<p>
“Normal people don’t choose on the basis of consequences, they just play roles. There’s a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll roaming the hallways. The little picture of Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can’t learn from experience or change herself, so there isn’t any point to this conversation. People like you aren’t responsible for anything, people like me are, and when we fail there’s no one else to blame.” -1505
</p>
<p>
<strong>Success.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“The one thing you absolutely needed to achieve greatness… an important problem” - p41
</p>
<p>
“So replan! Don’t let your life be steered by your reluctance to do a little extra thinking. You <em>know</em> that.” - p125 Sorting Hat
</p>
<p>
“Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me. I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would sacrifice my potential.” - p125
</p>
<p>
“The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly have said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it and found some more socially palatable arguments to the same conclusion - ‘you think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet lived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely to take up your wand if you lay it down.’ ‘Well… yeah, frankly. I don’t usually come out and say it like that, but yeah’” - p127
</p>
<p>
“I must achieve my full potential. If I don’t I… fail… ‘What happens if you fail?’ I don’t know! ‘Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?’ There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry’s mind. ‘You know - you aren’t letting yourself think it, but in some quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly <em>what</em> you aren’t thinking - you <em>know</em> that by far the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies…’” - p128
</p>
<p>
“For although you are ambitious, you have no ambition… I expect you will grasp at any opportunity for advancement which falls into your hands. But there is no great ambition that you are driven to accomplish, and you will not <em>make</em> your opportunities. At best, you will grasp your way upward into Minister of Magic, or some other high-position of unimportance, never breaking the bounds of your existence.” - 1073
</p>
<p>
“Harry had read once, somewhere, that the opposite of happiness wasn’t sadness, but boredom; and the author had gone on to say that to find happiness in life you asked yourself not what would make you happy, but what would excite you.” - p 1653
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nihil supernum.</strong>
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 8, Harry predicts he’ll have to convince Hermione he’s smart so he gives her the drink that makes you spit it out before she asks him to prove he’s smart and then claims to clean the mess by snapping his fingers.
</p>
<p>
“No matter what, it’s always your fault. Even if you tell McGonagall, she’s not responsible for what happens, you are. Following the school rules isn’t an excuse, someone else being in charge isn’t an excuse, even trying your best isn’t an excuse. There just aren’t any excuses, you’ve got to get the job done no matter what.” - p1177
</p>
<p>
“Even if it’s sad, I think that’s part of the environment that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who don’t have anyone else to shove final responsibility onto, and that’s why they form the mental habit of tracking everything themselves.” - p1179
</p>
<p>
<strong>Roles.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Because that’s part of the role of someone playing a concerned adult - you’d never change your actions, you wouldn’t actually behave differently, because of anything I said.” - p61
</p>
<p>
“On the other hand, it is less improbable that a young child would imagine this as the <em>role to play</em> in order to convince his teacher and classmates that he is not the next Dark Lord. The import of an act lies not in what that act <em>resembles on the surface</em>, Mr. Potter, but in the states of mind which make that act more or less probable.” - p307
</p>
<p>
“The Transfiguration Professor is reading from a script, Mr. Potter! That script calls for her to mourn and grieve, that all may know how much she cared.” - p1570
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rationalizing.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Harry plays a game where he creates a rule and Hermione asks him if any triplet satisfies the rule. She asks 4-6-8, 10-12-14, 1-3-5, -3–1-1, then guesses the rule is the numbers needs to increase by 2 every time. Then Harry tells her that only 20% of grownups get it right. Now she asks 2-5-8, 10-20-30, and guesses that the numbers have to increase by the same amount each time. The rule was “three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to highest.” - p107
</p>
<p>
<strong>Controlling yourself.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“When a Hogwarts professor challenged you, you did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed your claws, heedless of the danger. You escalated, and then you escalated again… The fact that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot.” - p292
</p>
<p>
“When there’s a confusing problem and you’re just starting out and you have a falsifiable hypothesis, go test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do it right away. Don’t worry about designing an elaborate course of experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a funding agency. Just check <em>as fast as possible</em> whether your ideas are false before you start investing huge amounts of effort in them.” - p350
</p>
<p>
<strong>Trying.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“You never called any question impossible until you had taken an actual clock and thought about it for five minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not five minutes metaphorically, five minutes by the physical clock.” - p415
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we try to condition on the fact that we win this, or at least get out of this alive. If someone TOLD YOU AS A FACT that you had survived, or even won, somehow made everything turn out okay, what would you think had happened?” - 1785
</p>
<p>
“More than a hundred horcruxes. That had been <em>insane</em>, there wasn’t any other word for it, a sign of Voldemort’s damaged thinking about death. A Muggle security expert would have called it fence-post security, like building a fence-post over a hundred metres high in the middle of the desert. Only a very obliging attacker would try to climb the fence-post. Anyone sensible would just walk around the fence-post, and making the fence-post even higher wouldn’t stop that. Once you forgot to be scared of <em>how impossible the problem was supposed to be</em>, it wasn’t even difficult.” - 1825
</p>
<p>
<strong>Truth.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. If you’re equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge… they didn’t notice how confused they were, and that meant they couldn’t be more confused by falsehood than by truth.” - p431
</p>
<p>
“Just as the fundamental question of rationality is ‘What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?’, there’s also a cardinal sin… they didn’t ask themselves if they had evidence which discriminated <em>that</em> possibility from all the <em>other</em> possibilities you could imagine, evidence they’d be very unlikely to encounter if the <em>wasn’t</em> true” - p629
</p>
<p>
“Spending money to save a life establishes a lower bound on the monetary value of that life. Refusing establishes an upper bound. If the upper and lower bounds are inconsistent, you could move money from one place to another and save more lives at the same cost… How very hollow the indignation of those who refuse to say that money and life can ever be compared, when all they’re doing is forbidding the strategy that saves the most people, for the sake of pretentious moral grandstanding…” - p1337-1338
</p>
<p>
“What people really believe doesn’t feel like a belief, it feels like the way the world is.” - p1363
</p>
<p>
“the existence of brain damage implied that there were no such things as souls.” - p1405
</p>
<p>
“The point of a subjective Bayesian calculation wasn’t that, after you made up a bunch of numbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right answer. The real point was that the process of making up numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh all the relative probabilities… One version of the process was to tally hypotheses and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation, and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain’s gut feeling <em>after</em> you’d forced it to really <em>weigh</em> everything.” - p1441
</p>
<p>
“‘Why does any kind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of maturity, of sophistication, like you’ve seen everything and you know better. Or because putting something down feels like pushing yourself up. Or they don’t have a phoenix themselves, so their political instinct tells them there’s no advantage to be gained from saying nice things about phoenixes. Or because being cynical feels like knowing a secret truth that common people don’t know… I think maybe that’s what <em>he’s</em> getting wrong – that he’s cynical about everything else, but not about cynicism itself.’” - Ch 65
</p>
<p>
This reminded me of PG’s <a href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html">Early Work</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
…inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh on early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem clever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups, those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just not when their predictions are weighted by outcome.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This idea of being cynical to signal maturity or intellect is something I catch myself doing often…
</p>
<p>
<strong>Modelling yourself.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“I’m voting that this is a performance, said Inner Critic. She wouldn’t just blurt all that out in response to one question unless she was looking for an opportunity. / Noted but I’m putting a low weight of confidence on that, said Ravenclaw. It’s very hard not to let your suspicions control your perceptions when you’re trying to weigh evidence that subtle.” - p916
</p>
<p>
“Note, said Ravenclaw One, we had already thought of that argument so we can’t use it to shift belief again each time we rehearse it.” - 1408
</p>
<p>
“If you didn’t <em>predict</em> that something would happen, if it took you completely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when you <em>didn’t</em> see it coming, isn’t enough to explain.” - p1413
</p>
<p>
" ‘Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind’s running in all different directions?’ she managed. ‘My own approach is usually to identify the different desires, give them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco, Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad, Mum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter.’ " - p1491.
</p>
<p>
“But there is another possible explanation, Mr. Potter. It is that people play the role of friendship. They do just as much as that role requires of them, and no more. The thought occurs to me that perhaps the difference between you and them is not that you care more than they do. Why would you have been born with such unusually strong emotions of friendship, that you alone among wizardkind are driven to resurrect Hermione Granger after her death? No, the most likely difference is not that you care more. It is that, being a more logical creature than they, you alone have thought that playing the role of Friend would require this of you.” - Ch 95
</p>
<p>
“Ruminating about the past can contribute to depression. You have <em>my</em> blanket permission to just never think about your past, ever.” Similar to putanumonit’s post on COVID. - 1892
</p>
<p>
<strong>Perspective.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children’s children’s children, the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from star to star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances, paling into nothingness in the light of that promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. You had to put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be remembered someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive, if you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into the beginning of all things, before intelligent life had come fully into its power. That the much vaster future depended on what you did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, where there was still so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like Dementors.” - Ch45
</p>
<p>
“Adults don’t respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they did, they wouldn’t sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead.” - 53

<strong><em>Favorite Quotes.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
“As well search for an eagle’s nest on the bed of an ocean, as search for happiness in the world outside of you.” (6)
</p>
<p>
“Look into the very real possibiliy that the reason why this person’s defects or so-called defects annoy you is that you have them yourself. But you have repressed them and so are projecting them unconsciously into the other. This is almost always true but hardly anyone recognizes it.” (87)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Know Thyself.</strong>
</p>
<p>
People tend to have similar goals, desires, fears, hopes, and dreams. Most want to be rich, successful, do meaningful work, be admired, loved, respected, happy.
</p>
<p>
Yet none of these are innate or fixed, though some come close. I think people will always want to be respected. But the other goals are valuable because they are linked to something deeper. Being rich → status → respect. Being rich → meeting basic needs and being prepared for emergencies → security → self-preservation.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that these are link chains. No link implies the next with certainty. Maybe there’s an 80% chance being rich implies meeting needs, but already this means attaining security is capped at 80% if we chase it through the “being rich” path. Humans are terrible at interpreting probability so this is hard to correct.
</p>
<p>
But there are billions of people with similar goals; surely, we must have converged on the optimal means of meeting our needs? I don’t think so, precisely <em>because</em> we have similar goals. This is just supply and demand. If donuts grant 100 utils and donutholes grant 1 util, and we have a lot more donutholes than donuts, the optimal solution isn’t for everyone to go for donuts. Having the same goals doesn’t mean we should all achieve them the same way. In fact, that’s the worst way to go about it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, all of this is just about why our goals and methods of achieving them are misguided. Now what?
</p>
<p>
De Mello’s answer: stop instinctively responding to things. Your programming (choice of goals and methods of achieving them) is deeply flawed. So do the opposite of what you want to do.
</p>
<p>
If someone forces you to walk one mile, walk two, so you can practice repressing that instinctive hate and desire to stop, choosing instead to just observe the instincts as they try to make you miserable.
</p>
<p>
And make no mistake: it is your programming/instincts that are the cause of your unhappiness.
</p>
<p>
An almost tautological definition for the cause of unhappiness is “life is not giving you what you need.” What every spiritual leader and person-who-has-thought-about-this-for-their-whole-life recommends is rewriting that definition of unhappiness as “life is not giving you what you have convinced yourself you cannot be happy without.”
</p>
<p>
Instead, we try to change life in order to make it give us what we want. The terrible truth about that is: it usually works - but it almost always takes a long time, during which you resign yourself to remaining unhappy. The typical example: working 40 years at a boring job so you can retire peacefully. Even if retirement brings serene happiness (which it doesn’t seem to), it was you who delayed that happiness for 40 years.
</p>
<p>
The answer is to change yourself. Don’t convince yourself you don’t <em>want</em> what you’re not getting. Rather, convince yourself you don’t <em>need</em> what you’re not getting. Then the want falls away too - a desire is only strong if it’s a necessity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Attachment.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Persuading ourselves is nearly impossible if we rely on willpower. So don’t. Instead, rely on sight: <em>see</em> that you don’t need this thing to be happy. This is super abstract, so here’s an example of a <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/05/read-this-if-youre-worried-that-youll-never-find-the-one/">thought experiment</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another observation: when we finally get something we deeply desire, we’re ecstatic. But without fail, we notice the happiness high fading after a little time. Dopamine triggers can’t be monotonous. Instead of dreading the hedonic treadmill, why not <em>internalize</em> it? Use it as a tool to notice the sabotaging nature of attachments.
</p>
<p>
How do we know what is attachment? Let’s construct a situation where a person can only have a single attachment and look for its key qualities. De Mello uses the example of a person in a concentration camp who suddenly gets a large amount of food. They hastily eat with their right hand, but use their left to keep others away. This positive emotion of thrill, elation coupled with the negative emotion of fear, anxiety is characteristic of all attachments.
</p>
<p>
What if, like most people, you harbor many attachments? By now you must have noticed this truth: even if you attain most of your attachments in one day, your mind will be swallowed up by the regret of not fulfilling the last one.
</p>
<p>
I think this is why <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier">gratitude journals</a> seem to make people happier. Actively thinking about what you have instead of what you don’t bypasses the anxiety of not attaining a desire. But still, simple gratitude doesn’t prevent attachment-based “gratitude,” so I don’t think it’s anything more than a band-aid solution.
</p>
<p>
Why is escaping attachment worth it? Because you will enjoy what you were attached to even more once you let go of that attachment. De Mello: “if you learn to enjoy the scent of a thousand flowers you will not cling to one or suffer when you cannot get it.” It is because of your attachments that you refrain from stopping to appreciate the varied experiences of life. But with increased variety comes deeper appreciation and enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Middle Road.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Consider the spectrum of all possible attitudes toward changing ourselves. Leftmost is contentness with our present selves and rightmost is striving for self-improvement.
</p>
<p>
As a child, I spent a lot of time on the left extreme. Self-improvement necessitates some ideal to strive toward and at this point, I hadn’t begun to seriously compare myself to others. If I’m lucky enough to grow old and unlucky enough to not see age-reversal in my lifetime, again I think I’d be on the side of pure contentness, though this time I think it’ll be because I don’t anticipate having a lot of time left and don’t think self-improvement is worth the effort.
</p>
<p>
So why have I been pushing myself to the right side of that spectrum if I know I must start and end on the left? Because the left side sucks: contentness is fine but it can also mean stagnation, laziness, sleep, pride, boredom.
</p>
<p>
The problem with the right side is that those comparisons with others that motivate self-improvement nurture self-hatred. Needing to become better means our current self isn’t good enough. Change is intrinsically violent, and so our failed and successful attempts at self-improvement are violence born from intolerance and discontent.
</p>
<p>
Finding a balance isn’t easy. Honestly, I seem to have found a compromise where I get the <em>worst</em> of both ends: an attitude toward self-change that remains both prideful and entitled while jealous of others.
</p>
<p>
De Mello’s solution is self-understanding, which can only be attained by turning off all desires to improve oneself. Any desire to improve oneself is born from ego. Instead, just observe your reactions to people and things with no desire for reform.
</p>
<p>
This itself brings about a change. All change is violent, but this isn’t violence grown from ambition. It’s a Natural violence - the “kind of violence that arises within mystics who storm against ideas and structures that have become entrenched in their societies.”
</p>
<p>
To be less abstract, become like a child. If children are grown-ups who haven’t yet succumbed to constant comparison, to revert back to that state we must seek out that spark of originality that was stamped out so long ago. What possible justification allows exchanging that originality for a life spent addicted to applause and those empty things called success and fame?

<div class="note-content">
<p>
<strong>Article</strong>
</p>
<p>
Imagine something crazy for me, quickly.
</p>
<p>
What if you peered into a fortune ball right now – this very second, today – and saw with indisputable clarity that you were never going to meet the love of your life?
</p>
<p>
That’s a sad thing that I’m asking you to think of, I’m aware. You’ve been hoping to meet “The One” for a while now – or at least someone half-decent who you can deal with for the rest of your life. I know, I know. You’re not fanciful like everyone else. You don’t believe in soul mates. But you were expecting to meet someone you liked a fair amount. Someone to curl up next to at the end of a long day, who would take care of you when you got sick and listen to your stories every evening after work. We all hope that. We’re human.
</p>
<p>
But imagine for a second that you knew – with 100% certainty – that you were never going to meet that person. What about your life would that knowledge change? Because here’s the thing about finding love – it affects us constantly. And we all loathe admitting it. But love is on the forefront of our actions even when it’s not on the forefront of our minds. It’s the reason you bought those new jeans last week. It’s the reason you went to that barbeque that you didn’t want to go to last weekend. It’s the reason you sometimes feel cripplingly insecure and inadequate and scared about everything that’s coming next. Love’s what inspires most of your greatest changes.
</p>
<p>
So if you knew, with indisputable certainty, that love was never going to be yours, how would you live your life differently? What about your daily routine would you alter? What about your long-term plans?
</p>
<p>
Your first inclination may be to say “Nothing.” After all, you’re a smart person. You have plans that don’t involve someone else’s influence. We all do. But ponder it a few moments more. Because here’s what we don’t want to admit about love: it is a crutch that we use all the time. The idea that someday somebody will love all our flaws is a subtle excuse not to work on them. The principle of two halves making a whole restrains us from becoming our own better half. We want someone to swoop in during our darkest hour and save us, but what if we knew they never would? We’d have to start doing everything differently.
</p>
<p>
If you knew that love would never be an option for you, what would be? How would you structure the rest of your life? Would it have a heavier focus on career, a stronger inclination toward success? Or would you use the time to invest in yourself – go on a few more vacations, travel further outside your comfort zone? If you knew that you would never again feel the rush of budding romance, where would you turn to for your thrills? How would you get your blood pumping?
</p>
<p>
And what about your other relationships – would they suddenly take on more weight? Would you spend more time appreciating your family, if you knew that they are the people who will have loved you the most strongly at the end of your life? What about your friendships? Would you nurture and care more for the people who love you platonically if you knew that nobody would ever love you romantically? Would you show up a little more often, share a little more of your life?
</p>
<p>
My inclination is to believe that never finding love would be a game-changer for most of us. One we’d initially consider to be devastating but may eventually realize is the ultimate liberation. Without the fear of ending up alone, the opportunities open to you would become endless. You could live on every continent. You could scale the corporate ladder. You could go back to school and get that degree you’ve always felt interested in, without worrying about the financial burden your debt may place on somebody else. Love holds us back in an infinite amount of subtle ways that perhaps we do not even realize. And the guarantee of its absence may just be the ultimate sense of liberation.
</p>
<p>
Because if we didn’t have to search for the love of our lives, we would finally be free to realize that we are allowed to be the loves of our own. That we can spend our lives developing ourselves, challenging ourselves, pampering ourselves and building ourselves up to be bigger, more capable people than we ever once hoped to become. We could become everything we’ve been searching for. We could construct our soul mates in ourselves.
</p>
<p>
If there’s one thing we all need to stop doing, it’s waiting around for someone else to show up and change our lives. Just be the person you’ve been waiting for. Live your life as if you are the love of it. Because that’s the only thing you know for sure – that through every triumph, every failure, every fear and every gain that you will ever experience until the day you die, you are going to be present. You are going to be the person who shows up to accept your rewards. You are going to be the person who holds your own hand when you’re broken. You are going to be the person who gets yourself up off the floor every time you get knocked down and if those things are not love-of-your-life qualities, I don’t know what are.
</p>
<p>
We have to start appreciating all that we bring to our own lives. Because the ironic truth is, you are most attractive when you’re not worried about who you’re attracting. When you’re living your life confidently, freely and without restraint, you emit the kind of energy that it just isn’t possible to fake. The kind of energy that’s capable of transforming not just your own life, but the lives of people around you.
</p>
<p>
So stop looking for The One to spend the rest of your life with. Be The One.
</p>
<p>
And let everybody else come searching for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thinking About It</strong>
</p>
<p>
I still don’t think I understand what it means to love unconditionally. To do something regardless of whether the other person reciprocates well or despises you even more, regardless of whether you think the other person will reciprocate. To do something purely out of love for the humanity of the other person and genuinely not expect nor be moved by gratitude or hatred.
</p>
<p>
I think my meditations on the HPMOR ideal of what makes humanity worth saving will help me learn unconditional love.
</p>
<p>
Another idea that rings true is that of real and true confidence. Not confidence in that I push my shoulders back and place a bored/neutral expression on my face to look confident and explicitly look for my nervous ticks so I can stop them. Actual genuine concern for the other person. If they don’t want you, leave. Not out of spite, not to make them coming running back, not to make them feel bad. But because it’s genuinely the best thing for both of us. Not in some morally upright way, but in a purely practical down-to-earth way.

<strong>Naive absolutes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
What was most striking to me was Kipling’s way of effortlessly explaining the shortcomings of absolutes. Endorsing absolutes is easy to communicate; nuance is harder to do well succinctly. Some of it is logical: “make allowance for their doubting too” says believing in yourself doesn’t mean lying to yourself. Don’t forget that other people also have valuable experience behind their predictions. Some of it is politics from experience: “and yet don’t look too good, not talk too wise” is the first level <em>above</em> publicly being an idiot and publicly trying to look smart. Most people probably recognize the truth in it, but there isn’t really an advantage to <em>not trying</em> to look good or sound smart so people don’t do it.
</p>
<p>
There’s no really unique content in the poem. The cautions are all things I’ve seen played out in movies or books. And yet they’re almost certainly things I’m going to fail at responding to in my life.

Chapter 1: Human Nature
</h4>
<p>
“This book is an inquiry into the nature of that human nature. Its theme is tat it is impossible to understand human nature without understanding how it evolved, and it is impossible to understand how it evolved without understanding how human sexuality evolved. For the central theme of our evolution has been sexual.” - p 10
</p>
<p>
“Everything can be inherited except sterility. None of your direct ancestors died childless… if we are to understand how human nature evolved, the very core of our inquiry must be reproduction.” -p 11
</p>
<p>
<strong>Of Nature and Nurture</strong>
</p>
<p>
“For those who protest that human nature did not evolve, but was invented <em>de novo</em>, by something called ‘culture,’ I have more hope. I think I can persuade you that our views are compatible. Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution.” -p 12
</p>
<p>
“Inside my skull is a brain that was designed to exploit the conditions of an African savanna between 3 million and 100,000 years ago… there is little reason to believe that the gray matter inside the skull changed much, either. For a start, 100,000 years is only three thousand generations, a mere eye blink in evolution, equivalent to a day and a half in the life of bacteria.” -p 14
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Individual in Society</strong>
</p>
<p>
“It is one of the remarkable things about the human race that no two people are identical… Every idiot can be father or mother to a genius – and vice versa… Indeed, this uniqueness goes further in human beings than in any other animal.” -p 15
</p>
<p>
“Every human being has two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so on. A mere thirty generations back – in roughly, A.D. 1066 – you had more than a billion direct ancestors in the <em>same</em> generation (<span class="math inline">2<sup>30</sup></span>). Since there were fewer than a billion people alive at that time in the whole world, many of them were your ancestors two or three times over. If, like me, you are of British descent, the chances are that almost all of the few million Britons alive in 1066, including King Harold, William the Conqueror, a random serving wench, and the meanest vassal (but excluding all the well-behaved monks and nuns), are your direct ancestors.” -p 16
</p>
<p>
“Little more than three thousand generations back, all our ancestors lived in Africa, a few million simple hunter-gatherers, completely modern in physiology and psychology. As a result, the genetic differences between the average members of different races are actually tiny.” -p 16
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ours to Reason Why?</strong>
</p>
<p>
“We human beings find the notion of engineering design quite easy to grasp and have little difficulty seeing the analogy with the design of an eye. But we seem to find it harder to grasp the idea of ‘designed’ behavior, mainly because we assume that purposeful behavior is evidence of conscious choice. An example might help to clarify what I mean. There is a little wasp that injects its eggs into whitefly aphids, where they grow into new wasps by eating the whitefly from the inside out. Distressing but true. If one of these wasps, upon poking its tail into a whitefly, discovers that the aphid is already occupied by a young wasp, then she does something that seems remarkably intelligent: she withholds sperm from the egg she is about to lay and lays an unfertilized egg inside the wasp larva that is inside the whitefly. (It is a peculiarity of wasps and ants that unfertilized eggs develop into males, while all fertilized ones develop into females.) The ‘intelligent’ thing that the mother wasp has done is to recognize that there is less to eat inside an already-occupied whitefly than in virgin territory. Her egg will therefore grow into a small, stunted wasp. And in her species males are small, females large. So it was ‘clever’ of her to ‘choose’ to make her offspring male when she ‘knew’ it was going to be small. But of course this is nonsense. She was not ‘clever’; she did not ‘choose’ and she ‘knew’ not what she did. She was a miniscule wasp with a handful of brain cells and asolutely no possibility of conscious thought. She was an automation, carrying out the simple instructions of her neural program: <code>if whitefly occipied, withhold sperm</code>. Her program had been designed by natural selection over millions of years: wasps that inherited a tendency to withhold sperm when they found their prey already occupied had more successful offspring than those that did not. Yet in exactly the same way that natural selection had ‘designed’ an eye, as if for the ‘purpose’ of seeing, so natural selection had produced behavior that seemed designed to suit the wasp’s purposes.” - p 18

“In physics, there is no great difference between a why question and a how question. How does the earth go around the sun? By gravitational attraction. Why does the earth go around the sun? Because of gravity. Evolution, however, causes biology to be a very different game because it includes contingent history.” - p 19
</p>
<p>
<strong>Of Conflict and Cooperation</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Every creature on earth is in a Red Queen chess tournament with its parasites (or hosts), its predators (or prey), and, above all, its mate.” - p 21
</p>
<h4 id="chapter-2-the-enigma">
Chapter 2: The Enigma
</h4>
<p>
“Why must a baby be the product of two people? Whynot three, or one? <em>Need there be a reason at all?</em>” - p 26
</p>
<p>
“In 1858, the year Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace gave the first plausible account of a mechanism for evolution, the Victorian brand of optimism known as ‘progress’ was in its prime. It is hardly surprising that Darwin and Wallace were immediately interpreted as having given succor to the god of progress. Evolution’s immediate popularity (and it was popular) owed much to the fact that it was misunderstood as a theory of steady progress from amoeba to man, a ladder of self-improvement.” - p 27 - I think this is my reason for evolution…
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pregnant Virgins</strong>
</p>
<p>
“For people, sex is the only way to have babies, and that, plainly enough, is its purpose. It was only in the last half of the nineteenth century that anybody saw a problem with this. The problem was that there seemed to be all sorts of better ways of reproducing. Microscopic animals split in two. Willow trees grow from cuttings. Dandelions produce seeds that are clones of themselves. Virgin greenfly give birth to virgin young that are already pregnant with other virgins.” - p 27
</p>
<p>
“Lots of creatures do not have sex at all or do it in some generations and not others. The virgin greenfly’s great-great-granddaughter, at the end of the summer, will be sexual: She will mate with a male greenfly and have young that are mixtures of their parents. Why does she bother? For an accident, sex seems to have hung on with remarkable tenacity.” - p 28
</p>
<p>
<strong>Of Sex and Free Trade</strong>
</p>
<p>
“A normal human being has two copies of each of 30,000 genes in every cell in his or her body. The total complement of 60,000 human genes is called the ‘genome,’ and the genes live on twenty-three pairs of ribbonlike objects called ‘chromosomes.’ When a man impregnates a woman, each one of his sperm contains one copy of each gene, 30,000 in all, on twenty-three chromosomes. These are added to the 30,000 single genes on twenty-three chromosomes in the woman’s egg to make a complete human embryo with 30,000 pairs of genes and twenty-three pairs of chromosomes.” - p 28
</p>
<p>
“Meiosis [is] the procedure by which the male selects the genes that will go into a sperm or the female selects the genes that will go into an egg. The man may choose either the 30,000 genes he inherited from his father or the 75,000 he inherited from his mother or more likely, a mixture. During meiosis something peculiar happens. Each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes is laid alongside its opposite number. Chunks of one set are swapped with chunks of the other in a procedure called ‘recombination.’ One whole set is then passed on to the offspring to be married with a set from another parent - a procedure known as ‘outcrossing.’” - p 29
</p>
<p>
“Sex is recombination plus outcrossing; this mixing of genes is its principal feature. The consequence is that the baby gets a thorough mixture of its four grandparents’ genes (because of recombination) and its two parents’ genes (because of outcrossing).” - p 29
</p>
<p>
“Put this way, sex immediately becomes detached from reproduction. A creature could borrow another’s genes at any stage in its life. Indeed, that is exactly what bacteria do. They simply hook up with each other like refueling bombers, pass a few genes through the pipe, and go their separate ways. Reproduction they do later, by splitting in half.” - p 29
</p>
<p>
“[Weismann said sex] speeds up evolution… The Weismann logic was profoundly flawed. It seems to treat evolution as some kind of imperative, as if evolving were what species exist to do - as if evolving were a goal imposed on existence. This is, of course, nonsense. Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a <em>directionless</em> process that sometimes makes an animal’s descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this. But nobody has told the coelacanth, a fish that lives off Madagascar and looks exactly like its ancestors of 300 million years ago, that it has broken some law by not ‘evolving.’ <em>The notion that evolution simply cannot go fast enough, and its corollary that a coelacanth is a failure because it did not become a human being, is easily refuted.</em> As Darwin noticed, mankind has intervened dramatically to speed up evolution, producing hundreds of breeds of dogs, from chihuahuas to St. Bernards, in an evolutionary eye blink. <em>That alone is evidence that evolution was not going as fast as it could.</em> Indeed, the coelacanth, far from being a flop, is rather a success. It has stayed the same - a design that persists without innovation, like a Volkswagen beetle. Evolving is not a goal but a means to solving a problem.” - p 30
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mankind’s Greatest Rival is Mankind</strong>
</p>
<p>
“The fallacy persists in the way many laymen speak of evolution. We talk blithely among ourselves about evolution being a question of the ‘survival of the species.’ We imply that species compete with each other, that Darwin’s ‘struggle for existence’ is between dinosaurs and mammals, or between rabbits and foxes, or between men and neanderthals.” - p 31 - Well, hold on. Isn’t the reason that evolution focuses on the species that any creature that <em>didn’t</em> evolve to focus on its species wouldn’t result in a long-lasting species? Doesn’t evolution select for species that preserve and strengthen itself?
</p>
<p>
“Suppose the individual is a tigress whose territory has recently been invaded by another tigress. Does she welcome the intruder and discuss how best they can cohabit the territory, sharing prey? No, she fights her to the death, which from the point of view of the species is unhelpful.” - p 32
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Rediscovery of the Individual</strong>
</p>
<p>
[George Williams wrote <em>Adaptation and Natural Selection</em> to explain why the group selection view of evolution was wrong.]
</p>
<p>
“[Williams] knew full well that individual animals often cooperate and that human society is not a ruthless free-for-all. But he also saw that cooperation is nearly always between close relatives… where altruists help their relatives, they are helping those who share some of their genes, including whatever genes had caused them to be altruistic. So without any conscious intention on the part of individuals, such genes spread. But Williams realized that there was one troubling exception to this pattern: sex. The traditional explanation for sex, the Vicar of Bray theory, was essentially group selectionist. It demanded that an individual altruistically share its genes with those of another individual when breeding because if it did not, the species would not innovate and would, a few hundred thousand years later, be outcompeted by other species that did. Sexual species, it said, were better off than asexual species.” - p 33
</p>
<p>
“Williams was inclined to conclude that perhaps his logic was good, but for animals like us the practical problems were simply insurmountable. In other words, getting from being sexual to being asexual would indeed confer advantages, but it would be just too difficult to achieve.” - p 36
</p>
<p>
“Yet this argument for sex is pretty unconvincing because quite a few animals and plants have abandoned sex or have it only occasionally… Water fleas can turn sex on and off again, which seems to prove that it has some immediate purpose beyond helping evolution to happen. It is worth an individual water flea’s while to have sex at least in certain seasons. So we are left again with an enigma. Sex serves the species but at the expense of the individual. Individuals could abandon sex and rapidly outcompete their sexual rivals. But they do not. Sex must therefore in some mysterious manner ‘pay its way’ for the individual as well as for the species. How?” - p 36
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Master-Copy Theory</strong>
</p>
<p>
One argument for sex is that it was invented to repair genes. When DNA is damaged, special enzymes notice and fix it by referencing its complementary attached base. But what happens if the entire pair breaks in one place? Sex provides a template of what the gene used to look like via outcrossing from another creature or recombination in the same creature.
</p>
<p>
Ridley doesn’t like this:
</p>
<p>
“If diploid creatures were to indulge in a little recombination between chromosomes every time their cells divided as the body grew, there would be plenty of opportunity for repair. But they do not. They recombine their genes only at the final peculiar division called meiosis that leads to the formation of an egg or a sperm.” - p 40
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cameras and Ratchets</strong>
</p>
<p>
Another theory is that sex facilites mutations.
</p>
<p>
“[Mutations] are acculumated at the rate of about one hundred per genome per generation in mammals. That is, your children will have one hundred differences from you and your spouse in their genes as a result of random copying errors by your enzymes or as a result of mutations in your ovaries or testicles caused by cosmic rays.” - p 40
</p>
<p>
The problem here is that the advantages of mutations are far too remote, occuring after generations of lucky mutations. Instead, the current theory is that sex is a way of reducing disastrous mutations.
</p>
<p>
“But why purge mutations in this way rather than correct more of them by better proofreading? Kondrashov has an ingenious explanation of why this makes sense. The cost of making proofreading mechanisms perfect gets rapidly higher as you get nearer to perfection… Meselson has come up with another explanation: ‘ordinary’ mutations that change one letter for another in the genetic code are fairly innocuous because they can be repaired, but <em>insertions</em> - whole chunks of DNA that jump into the middle of genes - cannot be reversed so easily. These ‘selfish’ insertions tend to spread like an infection, but sex defeats them, since sex segregates them into certain individuals whose deaths purge them from the population.” - p 44
</p>
<p>
Ridley doesn’t like this either:
</p>
<p>
“Kondrashov’s theory suffers from the same flaw as all genetic-repair theories and the Vicar of Bray himself: it works too slowly. Pitted against a clone of asexual individuals, a sexual population must inevitably be driven extinct by the clone’s greater productivity unless the clone’s genetic drawbacks can appear in time. It is a race against time. For how long? Lively… calculated that for every tenfold increase in population size, the advantage of sex is granted six more generations to show its effects or sex will lose the game. If there are a million individuals, sex has forty generations before it goes extinct; if a billion, it has eighty. Yet the genetic repair theories all require <em>thousands</em> of generations to do their work. Kondrashov’s is certainly the fastest theory, but it is probably not fast enough.” - p 45
</p>
<h4 id="chapter-3-the-power-of-parasites">
Chapter 3: The Power of Parasites
</h4>
<p>
“[Bdelloid rotifers] live in any kind of fresh water, from puddles in your gutter to hot springs by the Dead Sea and ephemeral ponds on the Antarctic continent… You can boil it for an hour or freeze it to within 1 degree of <em>absolute zero</em> for a whole hour. Not only does it fail to disintegrate, it does not even die. Tuns blow about the globe as dust so easily that rotifers are thought to travel regularly between Africa and America… No male bdelloid rotifer has ever been seen… Recent research by Meselson and Welch suggests that they just never do have sex. They have found that the same gene in two different individuals can be up to 30 percent different at points that do not affect its function - a level of difference that implies bdelloids gave up sex between 40 million and 80 million years ago… Nonetheless, the bdelloids are a living rebuke to the conventional wisdom that without sex, evolution can barely happen and species cannot adapt to change.” - p 48
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Art of Being Slightly Different</strong>
</p>
<p>
“[George Williams] noticed that sex and <em>dispersal</em> often seem to be linked. Thus, grass grows asexual runners to propogate locally but commits its sexually produced seeds to the wind to travel further. Sexual aphids grow wings; asexual ones do not. The suggestion that immediately follows is that if your young are going to have to travel abroad, then it is better that they vary <em>because abroad may not be like home</em>.” - p 48
</p>
<p>
The following mentions <em>monogonont rotifers</em>, cousins of bdelloid rotifers, mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
“Williams was especially intrigued by creatures such as aphids and monogonont rotifers, which have sex only once every few generations. Aphids multiply during the summer on a rosebush, and monogonont rotifers multiply in a street puddle. But when the summer comes to an end, the last generation of aphids or of monogonont rotifers is entirely sexual: it produces males and females that seek each other out, mate, and produce tough little young that spend the winter or the drought as hardened cysts awaiting the return of better conditions. To Williams this looked like the operation of his lottery. While conditions were favorable and predictable, it paid to reproduce as fast as possible - asexually. When the little world came to an end and the next generation of aphid or rotifer faced the uncertainty of finding a new home or waited for the old one to reappear, then it paid to produce a variety of different young in the hope that one would prove idea.” - p 49
</p>
<p>
Hold on, why produce 2 genders by the way? This comes up in the next chapter!
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Tangled Bank</strong>
</p>
<p>
Check out Graham Bell’s book <em>The Masterpiece of Nature</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Bell set out to catalog species according to their ecology and their sexuality… He expected to find that animals and plants were more likely to be sexual at higher latitudes and altitudes (where conditions are harsher); in fresh water rather than the sea (because fresh water varies all the time, flooding, drying, heating up in summer, freezing in winter, and so on, whereas the sea is predictable); among weeds that live in disturbed habitats; and in small creatures rather than large ones. <em>He found exactly the opposite</em>… Indeed, even the association between sex and hard times in aphids and rotifers turns out to be a myth. Aphids and monogonont rotifers both turn sexual not when winter or drought threaten but when overcrowding affects the food supply. You can make them turn sexual in the laboratory just by letting them get too crowded.” - p 50
</p>
<p>
The “tangled bank” theory is that if your parents thrived doing one thing, it probably pays for you to do something different because that niche might already be saturated. Bell thought this was the most likely reason for sex.
</p>
<p>
But there aren’t many ardent supporters of the tangled bank theory:
</p>
<p>
“An oyster that has grown large enough to breed is a great success, in oyster terms. Most of its siblings are dead. If, as tangled bankers assume, the genes had something to do with that, then why must we automatically assume that the combination of genes that won in this generation will be a flop in the next? There are ways around this difficulty for tangled bankers, but they sound a bit like special pleading.” - p 52
</p>
<p>
“Tangled banks predict a greater interest in sex in those animals and plants that have many small offspring that then compete with one another than among the plants and animals that have a few large young.” - p 52
</p>
<p>
“[Austin Burt] looked not at whether mammals have sex but at how much recombination goes on among their genes. He measured this quite easily by counting the number of ‘crossovers’ on a chromosome. These are spots where, quite literally, one chromosome swaps genes with another. What Burt found was that among mammals the amount of recombination bears no relation to the number of young, little relation to body size, and <em>close relation</em> to age at maturity… Man has thirty crossovers, rabbits ten, and mice three. Tangled gank theories would predict the opposte.” - p 52
</p>
<p>
“The tangled bank theory also conflicted with evidence from fossils… [Species] stay exactly the same for thousands of generations, to be <em>suddenly replaced</em> by other forms of life. The tangled bank is a gradualist idea.” - p 52
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Red Queen</strong>
</p>
<p>
“[Van Valen discovered] that the probability a family of animals would become extinct <em>does not depend</em> on how long that family has already existed. In other words, species do not get better at surviving (nor do they grow feeble with age, as individuals do). Their chances of extinction are random… It represented a vital truth about evolution that Darwin had not wholly appreciated. The struggle for existence never gets easier. However well a species may adapt to its environment, it can never relax, because its competitors and its enemies are also adapting to their niches. Survival is a zero-sum game.” - p 54
</p>
<p>
“Parasites are usually much smaller than their hosts, while predators are usually larger. This means that the parasites live shorter lives and pass through more generations in a given time than their hosts. The bacteria in your gut pass through six times as many generations during your lifetime as <em>people have passed through since they were apes</em>. As a consequence, they can multiply faster then their hosts and control or reduce the host population.” - p 56
</p>
<p>
<strong>Battles of Wit</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Parasites provide exactly the incentive to change genes every generation that sex seems to demand. The success of the genes that defended you so well in the last generation may be the best of reasons to abandon these same gene combinations in the next. By the time the next generation comes around, the parasites will have surely evolved an answer to the defense that worked best in the last generation.” - p 56
</p>
<p>
<strong>Artificial Viruses</strong>
</p>
<p>
“In about ten years, the genes of the AIDS virus change as much as human genes change in 10 million years.” - p 59
</p>
<p>
<strong>Picking DNA’s Locks</strong>
</p>
<p>
“Austin Burt’s discovery of a correlation between generation length and amount of recombination is evidence of the Red Queen at work. The longer your generation time, the more genetic mixing you need to combat your parasites” - p 59

<strong>Reading isn’t intrinsically good.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Reading is just tracing in pen what the author has already written in pencil. There is no learning being done because there is no independent thinking occuring. Reading then can make you stupid: if you continuously let someone else think for you, you forget how to think yourself. If reading is leisurely and pleasing, then you’re probably not thinking very hard. Most authors write superfluously to better explain themselves (hence the popular addage about books being too long). Find some other way to think so deeply that reading becomes arduous.
</p>
<p>
Reading a lot means that you’re less likely to remember what you’ve read. Your brain is being overwritten continuously.
</p>
<p>
Assume that the vast majority of books were written only to make money. Most of these are not worth your time. Never read a book because it is popular - ignore political, religious, or contemporary works. Bad books are intellectual poison; they destroy the mind. To read what is good, one must make it a condition never to read what is bad.
</p>
<p>
Popular books are popular with the foolish majority. Refuse these and seek the books written by the rarest of minds, of all times and countries. Read only books written by people who live for science or poetry. There will rarely be more than a dozen great book per century. Read these many times over and avoid the others.
</p>
<p>
People are quick to read works about great thinkers but rarely read the works of great thinkers. This is because it is easier to let someone modern take over your thinking than it is to work hard at translating an ancient’s thoughts. Refuse this compromise at all costs. Read Essays by Montaigne not A Life of Montaigne by Bakewell.
</p>
<p>
Immediately read an important book twice. You can only really understand the beginning after you know the end. Your mood will be different the second time through so you’ll even pick up a different perspecitve.

<strong>An External Brain.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Zettelkasten is a note-taking system. Notes are distilled into their individual ideas, and each idea is paraphrased on one side of an index card. Index cards are placed in a container so that related cards are located next to each other.
</p>
<p>
Our brains are unpredictable and mysterious. Suppose we wanted to build a better brain. Here’s an attempt at creating a communicating partner with the Zettelkasten that has brain-like features:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
<em>Linking of ideas</em>: We want to strengthen ideas by relating them to other ideas. The Zettelkasten accomplishes this by giving each zettel (index card) its own <em>unique, permanent</em> ID. This allows any zettel to reference another related zettel just by writing down the ID.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Arbitrary branching</em>: Ideas are most valuable when surrounded by the proper context, which isn’t always the source you first encountered the idea in. The Zettelkasten achieves this by making the ID of each card alphanumeric: to place a new card behind a related existing card with the ID 22, give the new card an ID of 23. If 23 already exists, use 22a. This allows for arbitrarily deep dives into any topic without premeditation on how to organize the information in a useful way.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Nonlinear and unordered</em>: Any sort of system with an order is doomed because it necessarily loses its functionality once it becomes very dense. There’s no way to predict which subtopics we’ll intensely study years down the road so any organizational structure which imposes a hierarchy of folders and dividers eventually gets to a point where choosing where to place information is harder than actually learning the information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Complexity only on the content level</em>: Our brains store an unfathomable expanse of knowledge without getting wrapped up in organizational details. The Zettelkasten’s simple structure allows us to mimic this feature. if we think something is important, we can defer to putting it in the Zettelkasten. If it’s important, other zettels will link to and from it. It it isn’t important, it’ll get lost in isolation. Both scenarios are fine (as long as the latter occurs in minority) which prevents paralysis of indecision of whether/where to add information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Higher-level thinking</em>: The Zettelkasten has economies of scale unlike other note-taking systems which become exponentially more cumbersome with the number of notes. At first, the Zettelkasten will just be a repository of information, but after several months, once it develops a critical mass of information, the Zettelkasten develops arguments and ideas on its own through the interconnectivity and new contexts of ideas. This requires a lot of effort, especially at first, to avoid the system from just becoming an archive of notes.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>A Better Brain.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It would help if our external brain could also help us get work done:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
<em>Easy to work in</em>: We shouldn’t have to force ourselves to be productive or work harder. Self-control is a finite resource that is depleting when used on tasks we’re conflicted on doing [1]. Tasks are easiest to get done when they’re well-defined, meaningful, and interesting. Here’s a way to monitor resistance and avoid it: count the number of zettels you write in a day. This is a reliable metric of productivity since each zettel represents a distilled idea.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Trust</em>: Any note-taking system needs to be trusted to hold what it’s important in an easily accessible way. The Zettelkasten ensures important ideas have many branches and a high volume of cards. It’s even beneficial to not commit everything in the Zettelkasten to memory: if you memorize a zettel, when you come across it, you won’t truly read the zettel but will think of what you remember it saying. Instead if you haven’t memorized, when you come across a zettel, you’ll read the full card and organically think of new thoughts that relate to it based on some other information you’ve recently read.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Atomic</em>: Generalizable ideas are where breakthroughs come from. Being able to truly explain the essence of an idea or proof demonstrates mastery of the topic and increases its usefulness because now you can try to apply that model of thinking to other topics. This means we should write zettels so we can understand even after forgetting exact original context.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Quick, reliable feedback</em>: Feynman said “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” We need accurate and quick feedback to keep us motivated and to accurately depict our current level of understanding. One way to achieve this is to use the following method for learning: write fleeting notes in a common notebook, then rewrite the important notes while keeping track of bibliographical information, and at the end of the day condense the important ideas into zettels to insert into the Zettelkasten. The key point is to paraphrase information in your own words at each step: multiple passes makes it more likely we’ll catch ourselves when we’re bullshitting understanding. Making the Zettelkasten the final step ensures that only the truly important ideas we can explain ourselves are inserted.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Backed up</em>: The problem with a physical system is that we can’t easily back up our work. One solution is to append another step to the process stated above: once a month, go through the Zettelkasten and write up an article that relates ideas from one big cluster.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Lessons Learned.</strong>
</p>
<p>
From personally using a zettelkasten, I’ve noticed the following:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
Minimizing barriers to adding a zettel is essential (<em>Complexity only on the content level</em>). I’ve found thinking of the cards as a flat ordering makes me less nervous about adding a card. To this end, I think a decimal ordering is better than an alphanumeric one. If the card ordering is flat, the numbers 22, 22A, 23 should mean the same thing as 1, 2, 3. The problem with this is in adding a card between 22 and 22A. What now? 22-A? I’ve actually noticed I get a little nervous when placing a card in a position where I can’t add a card before it. A decimal system resolves this. We can have 22, 22.1, 23. Now a card after 22.1 would be 22.2. A card between 22 and 22.1 would be 22.01.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
Here’s my preferred decimal system: when adding a zettel between 22 and 23, for example, I give that card ID 22.5. This way there’s less pressure to add a zettel before it (that would be ID 22.4) and adding one after is simple as well. There isn’t any bias toward adding before or after. Once I finish the tenth digits and want to add a card between 22 and 22.1, I’ll give it ID 22.05.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One caveat to this: when I’m taking notes in a structured order (while reading the <em>Sequences</em> at <em>LessWrong</em>, for example), the first card between 22 and 23 will have ID 22.1. This keeps ID numbers shorter when I know I’m more likely to proceed in a sequential order.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’m not sure whether the <em>Atomic</em> restriction is useful. I’m using 3x5 index cards to force myself to break ideas up into their individual parts, but I’ve found that this also leads to many ideas taking up multiple cards, which I don’t like. An especially annoying manifestation of this is when proofs span multiple cards. I’m considering switching to 4x6 index cards, though I’ll try this on some other subject I want to learn instead of just rewriting all my QC zettels on 4x6 index cards. I can still be atomic with 4x6 index cards but it’ll feel like a waste to have a lot of whitespace on some cards.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A list of just the names is important so I can see every card that exists easily instead of thumbing through everything. It also gives a different important perspective.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Keeping backups is really important since this is a physical system and is supposed to achieve economies of scale years down the road. Since the system is nonlinear, I’m going to add two slanted lines in the bottom right corner of each card. When I take a photo of the zettel and upload it to Dropbox, I’ll change the left slanted line to an X, and when I add the zettel ID and title to a Markdown list, I’ll change the right slanted line to an X. This way I know which cards I haven’t backed up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I don’t like using too many different colors on the cards, but I noticed that using blue pen for all the IDs makes reading cards much easier.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Since I’m keeping a master list of zettels, I need to update it every now and then. My original strategy for doing this was to go through all the zettels and check the bottom right corner to see if the zettel was entered into the master list. This is starting to become unwieldy because of how many zettels I have. From now on, I think I’ll keep any new zettels I add on their side, so that they stick up from the rest. This makes it easy to locate the ones I need to input into the master list and shouldn’t be annoying because I intent to update the master list often anyway.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I originally planned on doing multiple run-throughs of material before adding it to the zettelkasten. I wanted to use a notebook, periodically update Zotero with my notes throughout the day, and then update the zettelkasten once a day. I don’t think this is working well. A better method seems to only use a notebook to make quick notes for understanding for several days, then spend an entire day to review my notebook notes by uploading them atomically to Zotero, and then put everything in the zettelkasten.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I find that I’m constantly checking the Table of Contents markdown file. For some reason, this was making me nervous because I kept feeling like I should incorporate a better search method, which would necessitate moving to a digital system. This is ridiculous; I’m pretty sure my brain was looking for some way to avoid doing the actual work of making zettels and reviewing them, so it decided I should worry more about optimizing the form of my system instead of the content. Checking the digital ToC is <em>fine</em>. In fact, Luhmann constantly made zettels as mini-ToC for certain subjects within his notes. I should try doing this. The solution to this problem of feeling bad about checking the ToC is the same as the solution to most problems people have with the zettelkasten: try to make it a habit to <em>live inside</em> the zettelkasten. Get a feel for its structure and unique grooves.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I find copying notes from one medium to another boring, especially copying notes to and from Zotero. Zotero is a terrible system for notes and has little math support. It was so annoying to work in it. The solution <em>isn’t</em> a better note-taking system to replace it! I wanted to keep Zotero to keep track of my references and to force myself to rephrase things in my own words one more time. But after a little hthinking, I realize I could just write the sources of a zettel on the back of the zettel since I wasn’t using that space for most of my zettels.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Another reason I kept subconsciously wanting to move to a digital system was because I was afraid of losing my physical zettels somehow and needing a backup. This really isn’t a huge problem though. If I truly do live inside the system, I’ll remember most of the important content. If some terrible situation causes my zettelkasten to be destroyed or lost, I can start a new one and pick up where I left off.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I think a good way to get into the habit of living inside the zettelkasten is to make a daily ritual of rewriting the 5 worst zettels in the zettelkasten. By rewrite, I mean even splitting up a zettel is okay (because I find that I tend to think of the task of rewriting as simply making my handwriting better and not thinking about the content in the card I’m rewriting). Essentially, everyday find a way to create 5 brand new zettels from information already inside the zettelkasten.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I just rewrote my zettels with a different numbering system that has a 53-alphabet instead of a 10-alphabet. I was trying to decide which zettels would get a single alphabet (like A for “Table of Contents”, C for “Postulate 2 of QM”, etc), but then I realized if I really wanted to embrace the idea of flat ordering and non-categorization, I should just choose an order for the zettels and just number them incrementally. Like A, B, C, … without caring about their content and branching. I think this is a great idea.

<p>
<strong>Rough notes as I’m reading. Assume all are direct quotes from the book.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>This book isn’t well-written. There are sources missing from some big claims and I can’t find a lot of the stuff when I look it up.</strong>
</p>
<h4 id="chapter-1">
Chapter 1
</h4>
<p>
27: There is no biological law that says we must age.
</p>
<p>
32: <em>Magna superstes</em> was a very primitive organism that we think is the root of all life on Earth. It’s survival mechanism is based on two genes. Gene A stops cells from reproducing when times are tough. Gene B encodes a “silencing protein” which turns off Gene A when times are good so <em>M. superstes</em> reproduces when offspring are likely to survive. Neither of these genes are novel except for the fact that Gene B’s silencing protein has a repairing function and moves to broken DNA; this stops reproduction until the DNA repair is complete.
</p>
<p>
37: <em>M. superstes</em>’ survival circuit is why we are able to survive, but it also the reason we age.
</p>
<p>
39: Aging research today is where cancer research was in the 1960s: only treating symptoms instead of stopping to think about how to stop the disease. We have a robust understanding of what aging looks like and what it does to us and what causes it and what keeps it at bay. From the looks of it, aging is not going to be that hard to treat, far easier than curing cancer.
</p>
<p>
42: There has never been a unified theory of aging.
</p>
<p>
45: The free radical theory of aging argues that free radicals cause mutations which cause aging. People took antioxidants to prevent free radicals. This theory has been bunked decades ago but people still believe it.
</p>
<p>
45: Cloning gives us the answer to whether or not mutatins cause aging. If old cells losing information was the cause of aging, then we should never be able to clone a new animal from an old one. The cloned animal should be born old. Sure it’s possible that only the non-mutated cells are cloned but that seems unlikely. The simplest explanation is that old animals retain all the information to create a new healthy animal.
</p>
<p>
45: It’s a misconception that cloned animals age prematurely: extensive analysis of Dolly’s remains show no sign of premature aging even though she only lived half a normal lifespan. Meanwhile, the list of cloned animals who lived a normal healthy lifespan includes goats, sheep, mice, and cows.
</p>
<p>
46: Researchers gave up on a unified model of aging and instead identified multiple hallmarks of aging:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
genomic instability caused by DNA damaged
</li>
<li>
attrition of the telomeres
</li>
<li>
alterations to the epigenome that controls which genes are turned on and off
</li>
<li>
loss of healhty protein maintenance, known as proteostasis
</li>
<li>
deregulated nutrient sensing caused by metabolic changes
</li>
<li>
mitochondrial dysfunction
</li>
<li>
accumulation of senescent zombielike cells that inflame healthy cells
</li>
<li>
exhaustion of stem cells
</li>
<li>
altered intercellular communication and the production of inflammatory molecules This list is probably incomplete.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
50: Author’s theory: aging is a loss of epigenetic information.
</p>
<p>
50: There are two types of information in biology. DNA is like digital information: it can be reliably stored, accurately copied, and incredibly robust (can survive for hours in boiling water and recoverable from 40,000 year old Neanderthal remains). Epigenome is like analog information. Epigenome means traits that are heritable but not transmitted genetically. Epigenetic information is stored in a structure called chromatin, in the same way genetic information is stored in a structure called DNA. Epigenetic information orchestrates our cells.
</p>
<p>
51: DNA is wrapped around tiny balls of protein called histones, which assemble to form loops.
</p>
<p>
52: The epigenome tells newly divided cells what type of cells they should be and what they should remain. It’s why a skin cells doesn’t randomly become a brain cell. Without it, tissues become less and less functional until they fail.
</p>
<p>
53: Analog information can encode much more information than digital but its main disadvantage is that it degrades over time.
</p>
<p>
53: <em>M. superstes</em> has evolved into many different “longevity” genes in modern mammals.
</p>
<p>
55: “Sirtuins” are an example of longevity genes, named after the yeast <em>SIR2</em> gene, the first to be discovered. There are 7 of these in mammals: <em>SIR1</em> to <em>SIR7</em> and are made by almost every cell in the body. They descended from Gene B from <em>M. superstes</em>.
</p>
<p>
55: Sirtuins are enzymes that remove acetyl tags from histones and other proteins, and by doing so, change the packaging of the DNA, turning genes off and on when needed. These epigenetic regulators have evolved to control our health, fitness, and survival. They also evolved to requrie a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).
</p>
<p>
55: We’ll show later that the loss of NAD and decline of sirtuin activity is thought to be a primary reason for why our bodies develop diseases when we’re old but not young.
</p>
<p>
55: Sirtuins do what Gene B did by buckling down in times of stress and protecting us against diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, even cancer. Studies on mice indicate activating sirtuins causes DNA repair, boosts memory, incrases exercise endurance, and helps mice stay thing regardless of what they eat.
</p>
<p>
56: Because sirtuins do all this by a simple program based on Gene B, they are amenable to more manipulation than many other longevity genes.
</p>
<p>
56: Aside from sirtuins, a second easily manipulated longevity gene is called target of rapamycin (TOR). TOR is a complex of proteins that regulates growth and metabolism. TOR has been found in almost every animal (called mTOR in mammals). Like sirtuins, mTOR is regulated by nutrients.
</p>
<p>
57: The third well-understood and easily manipulated longevity gene is a metabolic control enzyme called AMPK, which evolved to respond to low energy levels.
</p>
<p>
57: Importantly, there are plenty of stressors that will activate longevity genes without damaging cells (certain types of exercise, intermittent fasting, low-protein diets, and exposure to hot and cold temperatures). This is called hormesis [“Hormesis: a fundamental concept in biology.” Edward J. Calabrese.] 58: Comlementing these approaches are hormesis-mimicking molecules. At least two drugs on the market can turn on the body’s defenses without creating <em>any</em> damage. We can mimic the benefits of exercise and intermittent fasting with a single pill.
</p>
<h4 id="chapter-2">
Chapter 2
</h4>
<p>
59: In 2003, after a 13-year-$1-billion project, we believed the entire human genome, each of the 3 billion base pairs in DNA was mapped. The remaining parts of the genome were considered unimportant. Yet this remaining genetic material accounts for about 69% of the total genome.
</p>
<p>
60: Even with a complete map, we won’t be able to find an aging gene. We found genes that impact the symptoms of aging (longevity genes are an example). But we’ll never find a gene that <em>causes</em> aging because our genes <em>didn’t</em> evolve to cause aging.
</p>
<p>
61: Robert Mortimer played a huge role in elevating <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, a single-celled yeast with a sweet tooth. Mortimer and his collaborator John Johnston discovered that these yeast cells are similar to our cells. There have been 5 Nobel Prizes awarded for genetic studies in yeast. <em>S. cerevisiae</em> shares about 70% of our genes. Mortimer and Johnston demonstrated that mother and daughter yeast cells can have vastly different lifespans.
</p>
<p>
65: Werner symdrome occurs in less than 1 in 100,000 people causes a person to age rapidly - the average lifespan is 46 years. The gene WRN when mutated causes Werner syndrome.
</p>
<p>
66: In yeast, the equivalent gene to WRN is Slow Growth Suppressor 1 (SGS1). SGS1 was suspected to code a type of enzyme called a DNA helicase. A DNA helicase untangles tangled strands of DNA before they break. Repetitive DNA sequences are prone to tangling and breaking. Since these repetitive sequences make up the majority of our genome, helicases are incredibly important.
</p>

66: After swapping in a mutant SGS1 gene, the yeast cell’s lifespan was cut in half. Many things can cause this but it seems Werner syndrome was induced because the cells seemed to age quickly: cells became larger and their descendant Gene A which causes sterility turned on earlier.
</p>
<p>
69: The epigenome consists of strands of DNA wrapped around spooling proteins called histones, which are bound up into bigger loops called chromatin, which are bound up into bigger loops called chromosomes. Sirtuins instruct some histones to bind up quickly while letting others flail around. This allows some genes to be turned on (these genes are said to be in euchromatin) and others to be turned off (these genes are said to be in heterochromatin). Sirtuins help convert euchromatin to heterochromatin.
</p>
<p>
69: Every one of our cells has the same DNA so what differentiates them is their epigenome, the collective term for the control systems and structures that tell the cell which genes should be turned on and off. The genome dictates what the epigenome can do (a caterpillar can’t become a human) but the epigenome still has a lot of freedom.
</p>
<p>
71: Studies of identical twins place the genetic influences on longevity between 10 and 25%, which is surprisingly low.
</p>
<p>
74: The Werner yeast cells’ rDNA was fragmenting. The loops were called extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (ERCs). This is a sign of age since normal yeast cells also were packed with ERCs when they grew old.
</p>
<p>
75: Inserting ERCs into a young cell caused it to age prematurely. Inserting extra copies of <em>SIR2</em> increased lifespan by 30%.
</p>
<p>
77: The evidence seemed clear: <em>SIR2</em> moves to the nucleolus, it does so to help repair ERCs; since <em>SIR2</em> moves from the reproductive parts, the cell becomes sterile, which is a hallmark of yeast cell growth.
</p>
<p>
78: Mammals have seven sirtuin genes: <em>SIRT1</em>, <em>SIRT6</em>, and <em>SIRT7</em> are critical to control of the epigenome and DNA repair. The others, <em>SIRT3</em>, <em>SIRT4</em>, and <em>SIRT5</em>, reside in mitochondria where they control energy metabolism. <em>SIRT2</em> stays in the cytoplasm and controls cell division.
</p>
<p>
78: In 2018, Katrin Chua at Stanford found sirtuins prevent senescence by stabilizing human rDNA. The same antiaging function found in yeast is confirmed to exist in humans.
</p>
<p>
82: DNA damage is inevitable. If we think of sirtuins as disaster-responders, it’s not so much that the sirtuins eventually get overwhelmed, but rather that they don’t always find their way back to their original gene station when the disaster is over. This is epigenetic noise: epigenetic factors like sirtuins leave the genome and get lost; wherever they end up on the genome alters genes by turning them on or off when they shouldn’t be.
</p>
<p>
82: How does the <em>SIR2</em> gene turn off genes? <em>SIR2</em> codes a specialized protein called a histone deacetylase (HDAC) that enzymatically cleaves the acetyl chemical tags from histones which prevents DNA from being transcribed into RNA. Whenever a DNA break occurs, <em>SIR2</em> moves there and removes the acetyl tags from the histones at the DNA break. This bundles up the histones to prevent the frayed DNA from being chewed back.
</p>
<p>
88: Horvath Clock is an accurate way of estimating someone’s biological age by measuring thousands of epigenetic marks on the DNA called methylation. <strong>I should try to find my Horvath age.</strong>
</p>
<p>
84: Mice were injected with a slime mold called <em>Physarum polycephalum</em> which floats around and cuts DNA in a mouse at just a few places when triggered by tamoxifen. All this does is break the DNA in a few places and cause sirtuins to be busy and maybe get lost. The mice with this aged 50% faster.
</p>
<p>
90: Bristlecone pine trees don’t age. Researchers couldn’t find any meaningful difference between 23 and 4713 year old bristlecones.
</p>
<p>
101: When treated with an NAD-boosting molecule that activated the <em>SIRT1</em> enzyme, the mice’s endothelial cells (which line the blood vessels) were pushing their way into areas of the muscle that weren’t getting much blood flow. Old mice suddenly became marathoners. Because sirtuins were activated, the mice’s epigenomes were becoming more stable.

116: If we could stop all cardiovascular disease, we would increase the average lifespan by 1.5 years. If we could cure all cancers, we would increase average lifespan by only 2.1 years. Curing one disease just means risk of getting another increases exponentially. Aging is the root cause of all of this.
</p>
<p>
120: Cigarette smoke contains a chemical called benzo(a)pyrene which binds to guanine in DNA, induces double-strand breaks, and causes mutations. The repair process causes epigenetic drift and metabolic changes that cancer cells thrive on in a process called geroncogenesis.

129: Places with centenarian-heavy populations eat more vegetables, legumes, and whole grains while cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugar.
</p>
<p>
133: Caloric restriction (CR) in rats and yeast lead to longer lifespans.
</p>
<p>
136: What we know about the impacts of lifelong calorie restriction in humans comes down to short-term studies and anecdotal experiences. But in the 1980s, we began a CR study on rhesus monkeys, our close genetic cousins. Before the study, the maximum known lifespan of rhesus monkeys was 40 years, but of the 20 monkeys in the study on CR diets, 6 reached taht age, which is roughly equivalent to a human reaching 120.
</p>
<p>
137: Rozalyn Anderson, a lead researcher in the rhesus monkey study, says a 30 percent CR diet for humans is a bonkers diet.
</p>
<p>
139: Participants in one study ate a normal diet for most of the time but turned to a restricted diet of vegetable soups, energy bars, and supplements for five days each month. After 3 months, they had lost weight, reduced body fat, and lowered blood pressure. The participants also had lower levels of IGF-1.
</p>
<p>
139: Mutations in IGF-1 and the IGF-1 receptor gene are associated with lower levels of death and disease. The impact is so strong that in some cases it’s used to predict how long someone will live. <strong>Measure my IGF-1 levels.</strong>
</p>
<p>
141: Any periodic fasting diet that doesn’t result in malnutrition is likely to put your longevity genes to work.
</p>
<p>
142: We need nine essential amino acids that are body can’t make on its own. Meat supplies all nine but comes with high cardiovascular motaility and cancer risk. Processed red meats (hot dogs, sausage, ham, bacon) are especially carcinogenic. Substituting animal protein with plant protein causes mortaility risk to fall significantly.
</p>
<p>
143: There isn’t a single amino acid that can’t be obtained from plant-based protein but any given plant usually delivers less than meat. This is actually good because a body in short supply of amino acids is under the sort of stress that engages our longevity genes.
</p>
<p>
143: All essential amino acids aren’t equal. Feeding mice low levels of methionine works well to increase a healthy lifespan by 20%. Even mice who ate as much as they wanted and shunned exercise lost 70% of fat in a month when on restricted methioine. Arginine and the 3 branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine also correlate with increased lifespan when restricted.
</p>
<p>
146: People who jogged at least a half hour for five days a week had telomeres that appeared to be nearly a decade younger than those who lived a more sedentary life.
</p>
<p>
146: Why does exercise delay the erosion of telomeres? Exercise is by definition a stressful activity: it raises NAD levels which activates the survival network. The longevity regulators AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins are all activated to build blood vessels, improve heart and lung health, make people stronger, and extend telomeres. <em>SIRT1</em> and <em>SIRT2</em> extend telomeres and protect them from degradation.
</p>
<p>
147: Running 4-5 miles a week reduces chance of heart attack by 40% and all-cause mortality by 45%. Intensity is important for engaging longevity genes so walk is distinct from a brisk run. HIIT is the best because it raises heart and expiration rates the most. Your breathing should be deep and rapid at 70-80% of your maximum heart rate.
</p>
<p>
148: Diet is still important; you can’t eat what you want and run it off. Giving rats a high calorie diet with lots of exercise has minimal lifespan extension.
</p>
<p>
150: In 2006, researchers at Scripps engineered mice to live their lives a half degree cooler than normal. Female mice had a 20% increase in lifespan while male mice had a 12% increase. They did this by inserting copies of the mouse gene UCP2 into the hypothalamus: UCP2 short-circuited mitochondria in the hypothalamus to produce less energy but more heat which caused the mice to cool down half a degree Celsius.
</p>
<p>
153: The UCP2 gene in mice has a human analog too. It has also been linked with aging repeatedly. In 2017, it was discovered that colder temperatures changed the way the UCP2 gene operated. Brown adipose tissue is a mitochondria-rich substance that decreases in amount as we age. It mingles with white fat and is spread out unevenly throughout the body. It generally takes a PET scan to locate it. Animals with abundant brown fat or subjected to shivering cold for 3 hours a day have much more of the mitochondrial, UCP-boosting sirtuin, <em>SIRT3</em>, and experience reduced rates of diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer’s.
</p>
<p>
154: Chemicals called mitochondrial uncouplers can mimic the effect of UCP2 by allowing protons to leak through mitochondrial membranes, causing not cold but heat as a by-product.
</p>
<p>
154: 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) was used for making explosives in WWI. It was later discovered that DNP markedly increased metabolic rate; people were losing 3 pounds a week. Soon, people started dying from overdoses and other long-term side effects. It is extremely dangerous.
</p>
<p>
156: Exercising in the cold creates massive amounts of brown adipose tissue. (read source on this 52 in Ch4)
</p>
<p>
157: We get the same effect in very hot climates too. <em>S. cerevisiae</em>’s lifespan extends 30% when they’re grown in 37 degrees C, just short of the maximum temperature they can sustain. The heat boosts their NAD production so their <em>SIR2</em> proteins work much harder. It’s also the same mechanism evoked by calorie restriction.
</p>
<p>
157: This isn’t the same for humans because we’re warm-blooded, so our enzymes haven’t developed a tolerance for large changes in temperature.
</p>
<p>
158: Going to saunas once a week seems to be good for you but studies aren’t conclusive.
</p>
<p>
158: A little cellular stress is good because it activates AMPK, turns down mTOR, boosts NAD levels, and activates sirtuins.
</p>
<p>
159: We <em>don’t want to</em> prevent <em>all</em> DNA damage: it’s essential for the immune system and even for consolidating our memories. (Read the source 57 Ch4)

</h4>
<p>
157: The single-celled organism <em>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</em> secretes an antifungal compound called rapamycin which was discovered to be an effective supressor of the immune system. It was effective in subduing the immune system just enough so that an organ transplant could be successful. Rapamycin is also useful for longevity: fruit flies fed rapamycin live 5% longer and mice fed it live 9-14% longer.
</p>
<p>
160: Rapamycin inhibits TOR. Many researchers are looking for “rapalogs” which are TOR inhibitors like rapamycin but with greater specificity and less toxicity.
</p>
<p>
160: <em>Galega officinalis</em> is a purple flower whose chemical composition is rich in guanidine, an indicator in humans of healthy protein metabolism.
</p>
<p>
160: In the 1920s, doctors began to prescribe guanidine as a way to lower blood glucose levels in diabetics.
</p>
<p>
161: Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough hormones that alert the body to sugar. This is widely treated by supplemental insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas can make enough insulin but the body is deaf to it. People with type 2 need a drug that restores their body’s sensitivity to insulin so cells can use the sugar coursing through their bloodstream.
</p>
<p>
161: High blood sugar can also speed up the epigenetic clock.
</p>
<p>
161: Oral dimethyl biguanide, a derivative of the <em>Galega officinalis</em>, is an effective treatment for type 2 diabets. This drug is now called metformin. It costs less than $5 a month. Except for a rare condition called lactic acidosis, the most common side effect is stomach discomfort.
</p>
<p>
162: People taking metformin were living notably healthier lives independent of its effect on diabetes. In 26 studies of rodents treated with metformin, 25 showed protection from cancer.
</p>
<p>
162: Metformin mimics aspects of calorie restriction but instead of inhibiting TOR, it limits the metabolic reactions in mitochondria, slowing down the process by which they convert macronutrients into energy. The result is activation of AMPK, an enzyme known for its ability to respond to low energy levels and the restore the function of the mitochondria. It also activates <em>SIRT1</em>. Metformin also inhibits cancer cell metabolism, increases mitochondrial activity, and removes misfolded proteins.
</p>
<p>
163: A study of more than 41,000 metformin users between ages 68 and 81 concluded that metformin reduced the likelihood of dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, frailty, and depression.
</p>
<p>
163: The beauty of metformin is that it impacts many diseases: AMPK activation and NAD production and turning on sirtuins hepls a lot.
</p>
<p>
164: A small study of healthy volunteers claimed DNA methylation age of blood cells is reversed within a week and, astoundingly, only ten hours after taking a single 850 mg pill of metformin.
</p>
<p>
164: Barzilai discovered several longevity gene variants in the insulin-like growth hormone receptor that controls FOXO3, the cholesterol gene CETP, and the sirtuin <em>SIRT6</em>, all of which seem to help ensure some people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry remain healthy beyond 100.
</p>
<p>
166: The first <em>SIRT1</em>-activating compound, or STAC, was a polyphenol called fisetin, which helps give plants such as strawberries their color and is now known to also kill senescent cells.
</p>
<p>
167: The second was a molecule called butein, which can be found in numerous flowering plants as well as a toxic plant known as the Chinese lacquer tree.
</p>
<p>
169: Zipkin noticed that fisetin and butein both have two phenolic rings connected by a bridge. He also pointed out the antioxidant resveratrol had the same structure.
</p>
<p>
169: Resveratrol is a natural molecule found in red wine and is something many plants produce in times of stress. Resveratrol actually outperformed fisetin and butein.
</p>
<p>
170: Resveratrol-fed yeast were smaller and grew slightly more slowly, getting to an average 34 divisions before dying, as though they were calorie restricted. The human equivalent is an extra 50 years.
</p>
<p>
170: Resveratrol in yeast cells with no <em>SIR2</em> gene had no effect. Resveratrol on calorie restricted yeast also had no effect.
</p>
<p>
170: Resveratrol being produced by plants experiencing stress is part of a common trend. We get resveratrol from grapes, aspirin from willow bark, metformin from lilacs, epigallocatechin gallate from green tea, quercetin from fruits, and allicin from garlic. This seems to be evidence for xenohormesis: the idea that stressed plants produce chemicals for themselves that tell their cells to hunker down and survive. We might have evolved to sense these chemicals as an early-warning system.
</p>
<p>
171: Xenohormetic molecules are often yellow, red, orange, or blue, so highly colored fruit are more likely to have them. They also tend to taste better: the best wines in the world are produced in dry, sun-exposed soil or from stress-sensitive varietals and also contain the most resveratrol.
</p>
<p>
171: Resveratrol-fed fruit flies and groundworms lived longer. Giving resveratrol to human cells in culture dishes makes them resistant to DNA damage.
</p>
<p>
172: Feeding resveratrol to fat mice: the mice stayed fat, but when disected, the resveratrol mice looked identical to mice on a normal diet, with healthy hearts, livers, arteries, and muscles. They also lived 20% longer. Researhers went on to show in hundreds of studies that resveratrol protects mice against dozens of diseases, including a variety of cancers, heart disease, stroke, heart attacks, neurodegeneration, inflammatory diseases, and wound healing. When resveratrol is combined with intermittent fasting, it greatly extends average and maximum lifespan: out of 50 mice, 1 lived more than 3 years which is the human equivalent of 115 years.
</p>
<p>
173: It turns out resveratrol isn’t very potent and isn’t very soluble in the human gut, two attribues that most medicines need to be effective at treating diseases.
</p>
<p>
173: Resveratrol taught us that it’s possible to activate sirtuins with a chemical. This prompted research into other sirtuin-activating compounds, called STACs, that are more potent than resveratrol at stimulating the survival circuit and extending healthy lifespans. Examples include SRT1720 and SRT2104, both of which extend healthy lifespan of mice when given late in life.
</p>
<p>
173: Another STAC is NAD, sometimes written as NAD+. NAD has an advantage over other STACs because it boosts activity of all seven sirtuins.
</p>
<p>
174: It turned out that NAD is a product of the vitamin niacin, a severe lack of which causes inflamed skin, diarrhea, dementia, and ultimately death. Because NAD is used by over 500 different enzymes, without any NAD, we’d be dead in 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
174: In the 1990s, we learned that NAD wasn’t just keeping things running; it was a central regulator of many major biological processes, including aging and disease.
</p>
<p>
174: NAD acts as fuel for sirtuins. Without sufficient NAD, the sirtuins don’t work efficiently: they can’t remove the acetyl groups from histones, they can’t silence genes, and they can’t extend lifespan. And we definitely wouldn’t see the lifespan-extending impact of resveratorl. NAD levels decrease with age throughout the body, in the brain, blood, muscle, immune cells, pancreas, skin, and even the endothelial cells.
</p>
<p>
175: In yeast, Sinclair discovered a gene called <em>PNC1</em> which turns vitamin B_3 into NAD. They tried boosting <em>PNC1</em> by introducing four extra copies of it into the yeast cells so they had 5 copies total. Those cells lived 50% longer, but not if they removed the <em>SIR2</em> gene. The cells were making extra NAD and the sirtuin survival circuit was being engaged!
</p>
<p>
175: The human equivalent of <em>PNC1</em> is <em>NAMPT</em>. Since <em>NAD</em> is so important, it might be dangerous to experiment with it.
</p>
<p>
175: Brenner discovered that a form of vitamin B_3 called nicotinamide riboside, or NR, is a vital precursor of NAD. He found that NR, which is found in trace levels in milk, can extend the lifespan of yeast cells by boosting NAD and increasing the activity of <em>SIR2</em>. Once a rare chemical, NR is now sold by the ton as a nutraceutical.
</p>
<p>
175: A chemical called nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN, a compound made by our cells and found in foods such as avocado, broccoli, and cabbage. In the body, NR is converted into NMN, which is then converted into NAD. Give an animal with a drink with NR or NMN in it, and the levels of NAD in its body go up about 25% over the next couple of hours, about the same as if it had been fasting or exercising a great deal. NMN could treat symptoms of type 2 diabetes in old mice by restoring NAD levels. We can make the mitochondria in old mice function just like mitochondria in young mice after just a week of NMN injections.
</p>
<p>
176: Which is the superior molecule: NR or NMN? We find NMN to be more stable than NR and see some benefits in mice that aren’t seen when NR is used. But it’s NR that has been proven to extend the lifespan of mice. NMN is still being tested. So no definitive answer (watch podcast to see if updates on this).
</p>
<p>
177: Human studies with NAD boosters are ongoing. So far, there hasn’t been any toxicity. Studies to test its effectiveness in muscle and neurological disease are in progress.
</p>
<p>
177: The way NAD treats diseases and extends lifespan is by creating the right level of stress: just enough to push our longevity genes into action to suppress epigenetic changes. In doing so, NMN and other vitality molecules including metformin and rapamycin reduce the buildup of informational noise.
</p>
<p>
177: We still don’t fully understand how noise is dampened on the molecular level, but in principle we know how it works. When we give silencing proteins like sirtuins a boost, they can maintain the youthful epigenome even with DNA damage occuring, like the long-lived yeast cells with extra copies o the <em>SIR2</em> gene. Somehow they can cope with it. Maybe they are just efficient at repairing DNA breaks and head hope before they get lost or if half the sirtuins head off, the remaining enzymes can hold down the fort.
</p>
<p>
177: Sinclair’s students and family members take supplemental NMN.
</p>
<p>
182: Sitting is almost as bad for us as smoking.
</p>
<p>
182: Sinclair’s father started taking metformin for diabetes and NMN. Six months into his NMN tryout, he was feeling less tired, less sore, more mentally aware. His liver enzymes normalized after 20 years of being abnormal.
</p>
<p>
188: Once you recognize there are universal regulators of aging in everything from yeast to roundworks to mice to humans. Once you understand that these regulators can be changed with a molecule like NMN or a few hours of vigorous exercise or a few less meals. Once you realize it’s all just one disease. Aging is going to be remarkably easy to tackle. Easier than cancer.
</p>
<p>
190: Young human cells grown in a petri dish divide about 40-60 ties until their telomeres become critically short. This is called the Hayflick limit. Although the enzyme telomerase can extend telomeres, it is switched off to protect us from cancer, except in stem cells.
</p>
<p>
190: In 1997, it was discovered that if you put telomerase into cultured skin cells, they don’t ever senesce.
</p>
<p>
190: Why do short telomeres cause senescence: a very short telomere will lose its histone packaging and, like a shoelace that’s lost an aglet, the DNA at the end of the chromosome becoems exposed. The cell detects the DNA end and thinks it’s a DNA break. It goes to work to try to repair the DNA end, sometimes fusing two ends of different chromosomes together, which leads to hypergenome instability as chromosomes are shredded during cell division and fused again, over and over, potentially becoming a cancer. The other safer solution is to shut the cell down. This happens, Sinclair believes, by permanently engaging the survival circuit. The exposed telomere, seen as a DNA break, causes epigenetic factors such as sirtuins to leave their posts permanently in an attempt to repair the damage, but there is no other DNA end to ligate it to. This shuts down cell replication similar to the way broken DNA in old yeast distracts <em>SIR2</em> from the mating genes and shuts down fertility. Permanently panicked cells send out signals to surrounding cells, causing them to panic, too.
</p>
<p>
191: Senescent cells are often referred to as “zombie cells,” because even though they should be dead, they refuse to die. We can stain zombie cells blue because they make a rare enzyme called beta-galactosidase, and when we do that, they light up clearly. Even though they stop dividing, they continue to release tiny proteins called cytokines that cause inflammation and attract immune cells called macrophages that then attack the tissue. Being chronically inflamed is unhealthy: just ask someone with multiple sclerosis or psoriasis. These diseases are associated with excess cytokine proteins.
</p>
<p>
192: Cytokines don’t just cause inflammation; they also cause other cells to become zombies. When this happens, they can even stimulate surrounding cells to become a tumor and spread.
</p>
<p>
192: We already know that destroying senescent cells in mice can give them substantially healthier and significantly longer lives. It keeps their kidneys functioning better for longer. It makes their hearts more resistant to stress. Their lifespans, as a result, are 20-30% longer, according to Mayo Clinic.
</p>
<p>
192: In animal models of disease, killing senescent cells makes fibrotic lungs more pliable, slows the progression of glaucoma and osteoarthrisis, and reduces the size of all sorts of tumors.
</p>
<p>
194: Intro: The primordial survival circuit we’ve inherited causes our cells to eventually lose their identities and cease to divide, in some cases sitting in our tissues for decades. Senescent cells are hard to reverse aging in, so the best thing to do is kill them off. Drugs called senolytics are in development to do that.
</p>
<p>
194: Senescence is a consequence of our inherited primordial survival circuit, which evolved to stop cell division and reproduction when DNA breaks were detected. If DNA breaks happen too frequently or overwhelm the circuit, human cells stop dividing, then sit there in a panic, trying to repair the dmaage, messing up their epigenome, and secreting cytokines.
</p>
<p>
194: Why doesn’t our body just kill them off? Williams proposes that we evolved senescence as a clever trick to prevent cancer when we are in our 30s and 40s. Senescent cells don’t divide which means that cells with mutations aren’t able to spread and form tumors. This is where “antagonistic pleiotropy” comes into play: the idea that a survival mechanism that is good for us when we are young is kept through evolution because this far outweighs any problems it might cause when we are older.
</p>
<p>
196: A class of pharmaceuticals called senolytics may be the zombie killers we need to fight aging on this front. These small-molecule drugs are designed to kill senescent cells by inducing the death program that should have happened in the first place. Kirkland did this with a quick course of two senolytic molecules: quercetin, which is found in kale and red onions, and a drug called dasatinib, which is a standard chemotherapy treatment for leukemia. This treatment on lab mice extended their lifespan by 36%.
</p>
<p>
196: If senolytics work, you could take a course of medicine for a week, be rejuvenated, and come back ten years later for another course. Rapamycin is called a “senomorphic” molecule since it doesn’t kill senescent cells but does prevent them from releasing inflammatory molecules, which is almost as good.
</p>
<p>
196: The selfish genes discussed earlier, the LINE-1 retrotransposons, and their fossil remnants, make up about half the human genome and is often referred to as “junk DNA”.
</p>
<p>
197: In young cells, these ancient “mobile DNA elements,” also known as retrotransposons, are prevented by chromatin from jumping out of the genome, then breaking DNA to reinsert themselves elsewhere. LINE-1 genes are bundled up and rendered silent by sirtuins. As mice age, and possibly as we do as well, these sirtuins become scattered all over the genome, having been recruited away to repair DNA breaks elsewhere, and many of them never find their way home.
</p>
<p>
197: Without sirtuins to spool the chromatin and silence the transposon DNA, cells start to transcribe these endogenous viruses. As mice age, the once silent LINE-1 prisoners are turned into RNA and the RNA is turned into DNA, which is reinserted into the genome at a different place. Besides creating genome instability and epigenetic noise that causes inflammation, LINE-1 DNA leaks from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it is recognized as a foreign invader. The cells release even more immunostimulatory cytokines that caues inflammation throughout the body.
</p>
<p>
197: Sedivy raises the possibility that <em>SIRT6</em> (?) mutant mice age so rapidly because these retroviral hellhounds have no leash, causing numerous DNA breaks and the epigenome to degrade rapidly instead of slowly. Convincing evidence has come showing that antiretrovirals, the same kinds used to fight HIV, extend the lifespan of <em>SIRT6</em> mutant mice about twofold. It may turn out that, as NAD levels decline which age, sirtuins are rendered unable to silence retrotransposon DNA. Maybe one day, safe antiretroviral drugs or NAD boosters will be used to keep these jumping genes silent.
</p>
<p>
198: By injecting mice with stem cells inactivated by radiation and later adding a booster shot like those humans use for tetanus, hepatitis B, and whooping cough, the stem cells primed the immune system to attack cancers that normally would be invisible to the immune system. Therapies which modify the patient’s own immune T-cells and reinject them to go kill cancer cells, are saving lives. If we can use the immune system to kill cancer cells, we should be able to do that to senescent cells too.
</p>
<p>
201: Vaccines against senescent cells, CR mimetics, and retrotransposon suppressors are under way already in labs. But what if we didn’t need any of that? What if we could reset the aging clock and prevent cells from ever losing their identity and becoming senescent in the first place? (does this question mean senescent cells are the root cause of everything?) The solution could be cellular reprogramming, the way that jellywish for example have been shown to do by using small body fragments to regenerate polyps that spawn a dozen new jellies. Since cloning works, we know the DNA blueprint to be young is always there.

202: There are 2 ways to play a scratched DVD with fidelity: buy a better DVD player (one with a more powerful laser that could reveal the data under the scratches) or polish the disk to expose the information again.
</p>
<p>
202: The first appraoch (putting a scratched DVD into a new player) was first attempted in 1958 when we removed the chromosomes from a frog’s egg and replaced them with chromosomes from an adult frog and obtained living tadpoles. We also did this with Dolly.
</p>
<p>
205: Shannon noted that if the data exceeded the channel capacity or was subject to noise (which occurs with analog data), the best way to ensure it reaches the receiver is to store a backup. Even if the primary data is lost, an “observer” can send this “correcting data” to a “correcting device” to recover the original message. This is how the internet works thanks to TCP/IP. The observer notes the errors in the recovered message and transmits the correct data to the receiver over a correction channel.
</p>
<p>
206: Since cloning works, we know the information to tell a cell how to reset is there somewhere; it is backed up. To end aging, we need to find an observer, correction data, and correcting device.
</p>
<p>
207: Shinya Yamanaka announced a set of 4 genes (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc) that when given to an adult cell could induce it to become pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which are immature cells that can be coaxed into becoming any other cell type. Sinclair thinks this is the biological correcting device. These 4 genes code for powerful transcription factors that each controls entire sets of other genes that decide what a cell will become in embryonic development. We call these 4 genes Yamanaka factors.
</p>
<p>
207: Sinclair predicts we can use the Yamanaka factors to reset an entire body’s epigenetic landscape, sending sirtuins back to where they came from for example.
</p>
<p>
208: In the future, we might give someone an injection of a specially engineered adeno-associated virus which would carry some combination of the Yamanaka factors and a fail-safe switch that could turned on with a well-tolerated molecule such as doxycycline. Then in your mid-40s, you would be prescribed a month’s course of doxycycline to switch on the reprogramming genes. During that month, your body would undergo a rejuvenation process: gray hair would disappear, wounds would heal faster, wrinkles would fade, organs would regenerate, you’d think faster, hear higher-pitched sounds, and no longer need glasses. Then you’d stop the doxycycline and the Yamanaka factors would fall silent.
</p>
<p>
209: In 2016, Belmonte triggered the Yamanaka factors for just 2 days a week throughout the lifespan of a prematurely aging mouse breed called LMNA. The mice remained young compared to their untreated siblings and lived 40% longer. Their skin and kidneys of regular old mice healed more quickly too. The Yamanaka treatment was toxic, however. Giving the treatment for a few more days made the mice die. They got particularly disgusting tumors made up of several types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, or bone.
</p>
<p>
210: Yuancheng Lu left out the c_Myc gene in the Yamanaka factors. None of the mice got tumors. Instead of testing it for a year to see if the mice lived longer, Yuancheng used a mouse’s optic nerve as a way to test age reversal and rejuvenation. Optic nerves typically don’t regenerate unless you’re a newborn. The nerve regenerated.
</p>
<p>
213: If we can reprogram old nerves to regain a youthful epigenome, the information must definitely be stored somewhere, a repository of correction data must be retained through adulthood. And it must be accessible by the Yamanaka factors. What the exact youth markers are, we still don’t know. They likely involve methyl tags on DNA which are used to estimate an organism’s Horvath clock. They likely also involve something else: a protein, an RNA, or even a novel chemical attached to DNA that we haven’t yet discovered.
</p>
<p>
215: Intro: By infecting mice with 3 of the four Yamanaka factors, the age of cells is reversed by TET enzymes, which removes just the right methyl tags on DNA, reversing the clock of aging. How the enzymes know which tags are the youthful ones is a mystery. Solving that mystery is the equivalent to finding Shannon’s “observer,” the person who holds the original data.
</p>
<p>
215: The “observer” can’t just be DNA methylation, because that doesn’t explain how the reprogrammed cell knows to focus on some of the youthful methyl marks and strip off the ones that accumulated during aging, the equivalent of scratches on the DVD. Maybe it is a specialized histone, or a transcription factor, or a protein that latches onto methylated DNA when we are developing in utero and stays there for 80 years waiting until a signal ocomes from the correcting device to restore the original information.
</p>
<p>
215: To continue the analogy to Shannon: when the “correcting device” is switched on by infecting cells with OSK genes, the cell somehow knows how to contact the “observer” and use the “correction data” to restore the original signal of a young cell.
</p>
<p>
216: We know from experiments (which?) that the biological information “correcting device” requires enzymes called ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs) which clip off methyl tags from DNA, the same chemical tags that mark the passage of the Horvath clock. This isn’t a coincidence: it points to the DNA methylation clock as not just an indicator of age but a controller of it.
</p>
<p>
216: The TETs cannot just strip off all the methyls from the genome: that would turn a cell into a primordial stem cell. How the TETs know to remove only the more recent methyls while preserving the original ones is a mystery.
</p>
<p>
217: So far, the 3 Yamanaka factor combination seems safe in mice even after being turned on for a year.
</p>
<p>
217: Questions we have: Can we deliver this combination to all cells? Will it eventually cause cancer? Should we keep the genes on or turn them off to let the cells rest? Will this work in some tissues better than others? Can it be given to middle-aged people, before they become sick?
</p>
<p>
226: We can read an entire human genome of 25,000 genes in a few days for less than a hundred dollars on a DNA sequencer called a MinION that plugs into a laptop. And that’s for a fairly complete readout of the human genome plus the DNA methyl marks that tell you your biological age.
</p>
<p>
226: DNA can also tel you what foods to eat, what microbiomes to cultivate in your gut and skin, and what therapies will work best to reach maximum potential lifespan.
</p>
<p>
231: More than a hundred companies help with this. Check citation 18 in Ch7.
</p>
<p>
234: In 2017, the FDA approved a glucose sensor you can attach to skin to provide a constant readout of blood sugar levels on your phone or watch. Patrick, a longevity scientist, uses it to see what foods give her a major sugar spike. This is good because sugar spikes can vary from person to person.
</p>
<p>
235: Sinclair has a ring that monitors heart rate, body temperature, and movements. It tells him each morning how well he slept, how much he dreamed, and how alert he’ll be during the day. Check citation 23.
</p>
<p>
358: What Sinclair does:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
take 1 gram of NMN every morning with 1 gram of resveratrol (shaken into homemade yogurt) and 1 gram of metformin
</li>
<li>
daily dose of vitamin D, vitamin K_2, and 83 mg of aspirin
</li>
<li>
keep sugars, bread, pasta intake low
</li>
<li>
skip one meal a day or at least make it really small
</li>
<li>
every few months, a phlebotomist comes to draw blood which is analyzed for dozens of biomarkers. When markers aren’t optimal, he moderates them with food or exercise.
</li>
<li>
takes lots of steps a day and walks upstairs.
</li>
<li>
goes to gym on weekends: lift weights, jog, sauna, ice-cold pool
</li>
<li>
eat lots of plants and few animals
</li>
<li>
stay cool when sleeping
</li>
<li>
BMI in optimal range which is 23-25 for him
</li>
</ul>
<p>
359: Supplements are far, far less regulated than medicines so be careful. Look for “GMP” on label (Good manufacturing practices). Nicotinamide riboside, or NR, is converted to NMN, so some people take NR instead of NMN since it’s cheaper. Even cheaper are niacin and nicotinamide, but they don’t seem to raise NAD levels like NR and NMN.

<strong>What’s the Epigenome?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The genome is the complete collection of all DNA base pairs. It holds the instructions to manufacture all the proteins we might need. Almost every cell in your body contains a copy of the full genome. The <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Epigenomics-Fact-Sheet">epigenome</a> is the collection of compounds that can turn parts of the genome on and off. This is what allows cells to differentiate. Some of these changes can be inherited during cell division.
</p>
<p>
There are <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Epigenomics-Fact-Sheet">2 (I think?) methods the epigenome uses to mark the genome</a>:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
DNA methylation: Proteins attach methyl groups to DNA. <strong><em>What do methyl groups do?</em></strong>
</li>
<li>
Histone modification: Histones are proteins that bind DNA into loops [p51]. Proteins can modify histones by attaching chemical tags to them. These tags will tell the cell whether or not to use the DNA that’s packaged by the histone.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The genome is to hardware what the epigenome is to software.
</p>
<p>
Sinclair compares the genome to digital information: it’s made up of 4 base pairs and incredibly robust (DNA can survive in boiling water for hours and is recoverable from 40,000 year old Neanderthal remains) and compares the epigenome to analog information: it’s complex and hard to copy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Epigenetic Noise Theory of Aging.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sinclair believes <em>aging is due to a loss of epigenetic information.</em>
</p>
<p>
A popular theory of aging is that it’s due to genetic mutations. The success of cloning efforts indicate this is false. If old cells lost important information, we shouldn’t be able to create young cells by cloning them. A cloned animal should be born old. This was first attempted in 1958 when we replaced chromosomes in a frog egg with chromosomes from an adult frog and obtained tadpoles. So far, <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/452444">cloned goats, dog, sheep, mice, cats, and pigs have been able to reach their normal lifespan</a>. This means the genetic mutations we acquire as we age probably isn’t the cause of aging; somehow, all the information needed to create a young animal is present in the cells of an old one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Longevity Genes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sinclair believes all life on Earth is a descendant of a primitive organism called <em>M. superstes</em>. Its survival mechanism consisted of 2 main genes. Gene A stopped cells from reproducing, while Gene B silenced other genes and had the capability to repair broken DNA. When there wasn’t any DNA to repair, Gene B silenced Gene A so the cells would reproduce, but when the cells were under stress, Gene B went off to fix broken DNA which meant Gene A was able to turn on and stop reproduction [p32].
</p>
<p>
There are many “longevity genes” in organisms today which provide the same functionality: reproduce when times are good and hunker down when times are bad.
</p>
<p>
Sirtuins (a class of proteins) are an example of longevity genes. There are 7 in mammals: <em>SIRT1, SIRT6, SIRT7</em> control the epigenome and DNA repair, <em>SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5</em> control metabolism in the mitochondria, and <em>SIRT2</em> resides in the cytoplasm and controls cell division (p78). Yeast has 5 sirtuins. Sirtuins work by removing acetyl tags from histones and other proteins, turning genes on and off (p55).
</p>
<p>
Sirtuins seem to do what Gene B did in <em>M. superstes</em>: activating sirtuins in mice causes DNA repair, boosts memory, increases endurance, and helps mice stay thin (p53).
</p>
<p>
Another longevity gene is target of rapamycin, called TOR.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Early Evidence.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Calorie Restriction and Intermittent Fasting.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exercise.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Temperature.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>NAD.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sirtuins evolved to require the molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, called NAD (p53).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapamycin.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Metformin.</strong>

<strong>Senescence.</strong>

A fair chunk of the book was spent persuading the reader that aging is worth attacking. I won’t cover much of that here, except for the following argument for the importance of fighting aging. In the US, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm">23.4% of deaths in 2017 were caused by heart disease</a> and <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/facts-and-figures-2019.html">22% of deaths in 2016 were caused by cancer</a>. However, because as we age, the risk of contracting diseases increases exponentially, stopping all heart disease would increase the average lifespan by only 1.5 years while curing cancer would increase it by 2.1 years [p111] <strong><em>SOURCE?</em></strong>. Preventing our bodies from weakening is a prerequisite to any meaningful benefit from curing many diseases.

<li><em>Ego is the Enemy</em> by Ryan Holiday <a class='collapsible'></a>
<div class="note-content">
<p>
I think of self-help books as void of content. Still they tend to make me feel more inspired and energetic. This book was especially inspiring, probably because I have a pretty big ego.
</p>
<p>
Humility is taking one step after another instead of allowing yourself to fantasize about the glory of the victory.
</p>
<p>
A corollary of the idea that when we discuss and fantasize about our plans with others, we tend to lose motivation for actually achieving them: when I buy textbooks, I lose motivation to read them; I actually feel <em>okay</em> with not reading them, which means I’m actually content with showing off that I know something to other people instead of actually knowing the material. That, or I feel that with the book so close, I can read it later, whenever I really want to.
</p>
<p>
I notice when I’m thinking about reading a textbook, I often decide to read something else, often labelling that thing as a prerequisite, then put off reading that other thing. I literally count procrastinating on reading as work for the day, without noticing it.

“Practice seeing yourself with a little distance, cultivating the ability <em>to get out of your own head</em>. Detachment is a natural ego antidote.

“It’s not about kissing ass. It’s not about making someone else <em>look</em> good. It’s about providing support so that others can <em>be</em> good. In other words, find canvases for other people to paint on. Clear the path for the people above you and you will create a path for yourself.” - p50

“Franklin wrote the Silence Dogood letters, submitted them by sliding them under the print-shop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until much later in his life. Franklin was learning how public opinion worked, generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and wit.

“You may find that there’s no reason to ever stop doing ths, even once you’ve graduated to heading your own thing. Let it become natural and permanent; let others apply it to you while you’re too busy applying it to those above you.

“Failure might happen tomorrow, it might happen 25 years from now. It could last 2 minutes or 10 years. We know everyone experiences failure and adversity, that means we’re all subject to the rules of <em>gravity</em> and <em>averages</em>. It means we’ll face them too. Humble and strong people don’t have the same trouble with these troubles that egotists do. There are fewer complaints and far less self-immolation.

“Malcolm X <em>chose</em> alive time. He explored religion, taught himself to read by checking out a pencil and a dictionary from the prison library and <em>copied it down longhand</em> from cover to cover. Prison was his college.

“In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even perfectly. Yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. Depending on what motivates us, this response can be crushing. If ego holds sway, we’ll accept nothing less than full appreciation.” - p131

“It’s far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to <em>outcomes</em> the better. When fulfilling our <em>own</em> standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort – not the results, good or bad – is enough.” - p132

“Maybe your parents will never be impressed. Maybe your girlfriend won’t care. Maybe the investor won’t see the numbers. Maybe the audience won’t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can’t let <em>that</em> be what motivates us.” - p132

“How do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work?

Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. This isn’t necessarily fun, by the way. It can feel like self-inflicted torture sometimes. But it does force you to always keep going, and always improve.” - p144

But no less impressive an accomplishment: being better people, being happier people, being balanced people, being content people, being humble and selfless people. What is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around.” - p157

<ul>
<li>
can’t short bad startup valuations
</li>
<li>
can’t short houses - this is why normal people can see a housing bubble coming and it remain uncorrected

</ul>
</li>
<li>
Cases where decision-makers can’t reliably learn the information they need to make decisions, even though someone else has that information
<ul>
<li>
this is why stock markets are efficient: the people with expertise gain money and then more people give them money so they can invest how much they decide is warranted.
</li>
<li>
now imagine everyone was capped at investing $1000 in a certain company. Then all the people with expertise can invest, but the stock might still be undervalued.
</li>
<li>
this is happening in medicine. Some problems are easy to solve but very few people experience them, so their small number of voices isn’t enough to get attention when everyone is screaming about something

Less than a majority of the time: Think about how reliable authorities seem to be and should be expected to be, and how reliable you are – using your own brain to think about the reliability and failure modes of brains, since that’s what you’ve got.

<li><em>Conspiracy</em> by Ryan Holiday <a class='collapsible'></a>
<div class="note-content">
<p>
“Our tendency to shy away from this truth creates a profound ignorance of how things really work, and what it means to be strategic, to be powerful, and to <em>try</em> to shape events rather than simply be shaped by them.”
</p>
<p>
“There is a moment in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> when Jay Gatsby introduces Nick Carraway to Meyer Wolfsheim, mentioning offhandedly that he is the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. The idea staggers Gatsby’s idealistic young friend. Of course, Carraway knew the series had been thrown. But”if I had thought of it at all," he says, “I would have thought of it as a thing that merely <em>happened</em>, the end of some inevitable chain.” It was unbelievable to him then, as it is to us now, that a single person could have been responsible for changing the outcome of an event watched by some fifty million people."
</p>
<p>
“‘How did he happen to do that?’ he asks of the 1919 World Series plot. Gatsby answers: ‘He just saw the opportunity.’ Thiel had seen the opportunity where no one else had. He had taken it.”
</p>
<p>
“The 1919 World Series was fixed… with great skill and audacity by Arnold Rothstein, a Jewish gangster… Dwight Eisenhower eagerly followed the game as the scores came in via telegram, and like everyone else, never suspected a thing. He would remark years later that the revelation of the conspiracy that had thrown the series produced a profound change in his perspective about the world; it taught him never to trust in first appearances.”
</p>
<p>
“Rich Cohen once wrote that ‘one definition of evil is to fail to recognize the humanity in the other: to see a person as an object or tool, something to be put to use.’”
</p>
<p>
“It has been the great collective self-deception of Silicon Valley… that a person can engage in aggressive ‘disruption’… while pretending they are not at least similar to the ruthless capitalist barons of the previous centuries, that there is not a drop of Carnegie or Rockefeller or Vanderbilt DNA in the whole business.”
</p>
<p>
“One of the informal mottos of the libertarian community is ‘Don’t hurt people and don’t take their stuff.’”
</p>
<p>
“One can’t see one’s choices as simply selfish or personal or one would not have the strength to do what ultimately needs to be done… It became important for Thiel to see Gawker as singularly bad… Thiel has to make himself the lightning and the thunder that cannot be appealed against, just as all who would attempt to bend society to their will must do. To not do so would <em>imperil the entire operation they have just begun planning</em>. The Count of Monte Cristo would put it better: ‘What a fool I was not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself…’ William James knew that every man is ‘ready to be savage in some cause.’ The distinction, he said, between good people and bad people is ‘the choice of the cause.’”
</p>
<p>
“The paradox is that if one is too concerned about [the criticism or consequences of Ross Ulbricht building the Silk Road and ordering murders], one will never proceed.”
</p>
<p>
“The essential trait of the successful man is not only perseverance but almost a <em>perverse expectation of how difficult it is going to be</em>. It is having redundancies on top of redundancies, so you can absorb the losses you eventually incur.”
</p>
<p>
“History is, if anything, one long exercise in the triumph of secrets.”
</p>
<p>
“[Honesty and truth] do well for a child’s copybook, but a man who acts on them had better sheathe his sword forever.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no such thing as an ‘almost secret’ conspiracy of any significance.”
</p>
<p>
“The less the conspirators know about the leader’s plan, the less likely they are to expose them — the less likely they are to undermine or question them. The less likely it is that the enemy will find out and block them.”
</p>
<p>
“In every conspiracy, there is temptation to talk, especially as you near your goal. The weight of silence and deceit begins to weigh on the participants… [Your friends speak] with such ease about their recent successes… yet you can say nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Psychologically, there is this weird thing where you want to brag about these things that you’re not supposed to,’ Thiel would say to me. Freud explained the phenomenon a hundred years ago: ‘He that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his finger-tips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore…’ Just as rules are meant to be broken, it seems, secrets are meant to be shared.”
</p>
<p>
“The concealment of intentions is critical to countless worthwhile and [even] perfectly legetimate enterprises… even jouranlism… ‘If everybody put his cards on the table, the game would be over. The journalist must do his work in a kind of deliberate induced state of <em>moral anarchy</em>.’”
</p>
<p>
“‘The truest way to be deceived is to think oneself more knowing than others’ is La Rochefoucauld’s maxim.”
</p>
<p>
“‘I do think you <em>always want to think about</em>, you know, when this ultimately comes out. Is it defensible? And I think all the things we did were defensible. And so secrets aren’t necessarily forever. You have to live with it coming out at the end.’ Secrets are how real work is done.”
</p>
<p>
“Agents of conspiracy would be foolish to simply set it and forget it, to close themselves off to other opportunities just because they had already invested in one.”
</p>
<p>
“‘At some point the word ’strategy’ becomes a euphemism for procrastination. A lot of different plans, a lot of different plans, and they will take a long time and you never —’ and there he cut himself off as he so often does. So I’ll finish it for him. You would never end up going to the <em>trial</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“[Peter Drucker said] ‘<em>culture eats strategy</em>’… It doesn’t matter how great your plan is, it doesn’t matter who your people are, if what binds them together is weak or toxic, so, too, will be the outcome — if you even get that far. But if the ties that bind you together are strong, if you have a sense of purpose and mission, you can withstand great trials.”
</p>
<p>
“To maintain loyalty and faith among conspirators… ‘it must be indeed that the hatred is great or that your authority is <em>very</em> great.’”
</p>
<p>
“Churchill once compared an offensive force to throwing a bucket of water over the floor: ‘It rushes forward, then soaks forward, and finally stops altogether until another bucket can be brought.’ It’s the moment <em>in between those buckets</em> when a conspiracy is most vulnerable, because the combination of stasis and exposure begins to evaporate those ties that bind. But even more than that, it is here that one has the brief time to reflex and consider: <em>Is it worth another try? Do I have it in me?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Machiavelli: ‘Anyone who is threatened and is forced by necessity either to act or to suffer becomes a very dangerous man to the prince.’”
</p>
<p>
“‘The terrible thing about people like you is that decent people have to become so much like you in order to stop you — in order to survive.’”
</p>
<p>
“Perfect is the enemy of good. Clausewitz warned generals about the ‘culiminating point of victory.’ A point where, if blindly ridden past, flush with the momentum of winning and strength, you <em>imperil everything you have achieved</em>. The deision to attack one additional city, to charge after the enemy who has retreated, or to extend the battle for one more day might not just be subject to diminishing returns, it might <em>snatch defeats from the jaws of victory</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Cunning and resources might win the war, but it’s the stories and the myths <em>afterward</em> that will determine who <em>deserved</em> to win it. How one rides out the chaos in the aftermath of a deed is <em>everything</em>. Winning, succeeding, pulling off the complex operation is the last step of one journey but simultaneously the first step in the next one, one arguably more important and difficult than what came before. The next step is <em>holding on to the victory</em>. No matter how brilliant you are, how impressive the conspiracy was — it will be defined by what comes after.”
</p>
<p>
“Violence is reciprocal and imitative. It escalates in a never-ending cycle, often taking society with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Of the dangers after a successful conspiracy, Machiavelli would say, ‘there is only one, and that is when someone is left who may avenge the dead prince…’ After David fells Goliath with his well-placed stone, that’s not the end of it. Then began the gruesome work of hacking off the giant’s head.”
</p>
<p>
“Without a way out, tensions only increase and combatants have no choice but to fight on. Scipio Africanus, the general who defeated Hannibal, would say that an army should not only leave the road for their enemy to retreat by they should <em>pave</em> it. The Romans had a name for this road, the Gallic Way.”
</p>
<p>
“What, if anything, would come as a surprise? His own power and strength for one… Reality seems, somehow, more malleable than it did before.”
</p>
<p>
“[What is the relation between Thiel’s involvement in destroying Gawker and his endorsement of Trump?] One is a conspiracy, the other a crime of opportunity.”
</p>
<p>
“I would ask Mr. A… what he made of it all. He would smile and tell him, ‘I don’t care about politics, I only care that my friends are in power.’”
</p>
<p>
“It became clear to me that a referendum on the merits of a specific conspiracy would be somewhat pointless… I decided not to make a final statement but chose instead to deal in tactics. I rounded no rough edges and I’ll leave it to other experts to sort through exactly what the implications of this case are.”

“The most important theme of the book is natural selection. As I explain, it is this basic mechanism that makes biology different from all other sciences… Anyone can grasp the mechnism itself, though remarkably few people actually do so.” - p 16
</p>
<p>
“Natural selection almost always builds on what went before, so that a basically simple process becomes encumbered with many subsidiary gadgets… It is the resulting complexity that makes biological organisms so hard to unscramble. Biology is thus very different from physics. The basic laws of physics can usually be expressed in exact mathematical form, and they are probably the same throughout the universe.” - p 16
</p>
<p>
“All this can make it difficult for a physicist to contribute to biological research. Elegance and a deep simplicity are useful guides in physics, but in biology such intellectual tools can be very misleading.” - p 16
</p>
<p>
“I myself knew very little biology till I was over thirty, since my first degree was in physics. It took me a little time to adjust to the rather different way of thinking necessary in biology. It was almost as if one had to be born again. Yet such a transition is not as difficult as all that and is certainly well worth the effort.” - p 16

“I have no doubt, as will emerge later, that this loss of faith in Christian religion and my growing attachment to science have played a dominant part in my scientific career, not so much on a day-to-day basis but in the choice of what I have considered interesting and important… What could be more foolish than to base one’s entire view of life on ideas that, however plausible at the time, now appear to be quite erroneous?” - p 20

“Andrade put me onto the dullest problem imaginable, the determination of the viscosity of water, under pressure, between 100 and 150 degrees C… What I <em>had</em> acquired, however indirectly, was the hubris of the physicist, the feeling that physics as a discipline was highly successful, so why should not other sciences do likewise? I believe this did help me when, after the war, I eventually switched to biophysics.” - p 22

<h2 id="career">
Career
</h2>
<p>
“Only gradually did I realize that this lack of qualification could be an advantage. By the time most scientists have reached age thirty they are trapped by their own expertise. They have invested so much effort in one particular field that it is often extremely difficult, at that time in their careers, to make a radical change.” - p 24
</p>
<p>
“I had discovered the gossip test - what you are really interested in is what you gossip about.” - p 25

<p>
“The main advantage was that the work was not too demanding and left me plenty of time for extensive reading in my new subject.” - p 30
</p>
<p>
“Many proteins, if heated briefly to the boiling point of water, became denatured, as if they had unfolded so that their three-dimensional structure had been partly destroyed. When this happened the denatured protein usually lost its catalytic or other function, strongly suggesting that the function of such a protein <em>depended on its exact three-dimensional structure</em>.” - p 52
</p>
<p>
“As a beginner in research, still almost an amateur… I think at the back of my mind was the idea that science was an occupation for gentlemen. Incredible as it may seem, I had not realized that for many it was a highly competitive career.” - p 63
</p>
<p>
“The existing textbooks usually used a step-by-step method, based largely on Bragg’s law and the historical development of the subject. To someone like myself this only made it more difficult and certainly more tedious, since an elementary method often arouses deeper questions in the learner and these worries can impede one’s progress in learning. It is often better, at least for brighter pupils, to go straight to the advanced treatment and try to get over the more powerful formalism while at the same time attempting to provide some insight into what is going on.” - p 65
</p>
<p>
“Meanwhile Bragg had independently thought about it. Whereas I had gotten bogged down, he made rapid progress. He boldly assumed that one could approximate the shape by an ellipsoid – a particularly simple type of distorted sphere. Then he looked at what little was known of the crystals of hemoglobin of other species of animal, on the assumption that all types of hemoglobin molecules were likely to have about the same shape. Moreover, he was not disturbed if the data did not <em>exactly</em> fit his model, since it was unllikely that the molecule was <em>exactly</em> an ellipsoid. In otherwords, he made bold, simplifying assumptions; looked at as wide a range of data as possible; and was critical but not pernickety, as I had been, about the fit between his model and experimental facts. He arrived at a shape that we now know is not a bad approximation to the molecule’s real shape… The result was not of first-class importance, if only because the method was indirect and needed confirmation by more direct methods, but it was a revelation to me as to how to do scientific research.” - p 67
</p>
<p>
“There was some justification for his annoyance. A group of people engaged in a difficult and somewhat uncertain undertaking are not helped by persistent negative criticism from one of their number. It destroys the mood of confidence necessary to carry through such a hazardous enterprise to a successful conclusion. But equally it is useless to persist in a course of action that is bound to fail, especially if alternate methods exist.” - p 71
</p>
<p>
“It is interesting to note the curious mental attitude of scientists working on ‘hopeless’ subjects. Contrary to what one might at first expect, they are all buoyed up with irrepressible optimism. I believe there is a simple explanation for this. Anyone without such optimism simply leaves the field and takes up some other line of work. Only the optimists remain. So one has the curious phenomenon that workers in subjects in which the prize is big but the prospects of success very small always appear very optimistic. And this in spite of the fact that, although plenty appears to be going on, they never seem to get appreciably nearer their goal.” - p 72
</p>
<p>
“Sir Lawrence Bragg was one of those scientists with a boyish enthusiasm for research, which he never lost. He was also a keen gardener. When he moved in 1954 from his large house and garden in West Road, Cambridge, to London, to head the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street, he lived in the official apartment at the top of the building. Missing his garden, he arranged that for one afternoon each week he would hire himself out as a gardener to an unknown lady living in The Boltons, a select inner-London suburb. He respectfully tipped his hat to her and told her his name was Willie. For several months all went well till one day a visitor glancing out of the window, said to her hostess, ‘My dear, what <em>is</em> Sir Lawrence Bragg doing in your garden?’ I can think of few other scientists of his distinction who would do something like this.” - p 74
</p>
<p>
“Bragg had a great gift for seeing problems in simple terms, realizing that many apparent complications fall away if the basic underlying pattern could be discovered. It was thus not surprising that in 1950 he wanted to show that at least some stretches of the polypeptide chain in a protein folded up in a simple manner.” - p 74
</p>
<p>
“DNA is, at bottom, a much less sophisticated molecule than a highly evolved protein and for this reason reveals its secret more easily. We were not to know this in advance - it was just good luck that we stumbled onto such a beautiful structue.” - p 83
</p>
<p>
“I believe there is a good reason for the simplicity of the nucleic acids. They probably go back to the origin of life, or at least very close to it. At that time mechanisms had to be fairly simple or life could not have started. Of course the very existence of cehmical molecules can only be explained by quantum mechanics, but fortunately the shape of a chemical molecule can be embodied rather easily in a mechanical model, and it is this that makes the ideas easy to understand.” - p 86
</p>
<p>
“But it was not all due to competitiveness. It was because we passionately wnated to know the details of the structure. This, then, was a powerful force in our favor. I believe there were at least two others. Neither Jim not I felt any external pressure to get on with the problem. This meant that we could approach it intensively for a period and then leave it alone for a bit. Our other advantage was that we had evolved unstated by fruitful methods of collaboration… If either of us suggested a new idea the other, while taking it seriously, would attempt to demolish it in a candid but nonhostile manner. This turned out to be quite crucial. In solving scientific problems of this type, it is almost impossible to avoid falling into error… to obtain the correct solution of a problem, unless it is transparently easy, usually requires a <em>sequence</em> of logical steps. If one of these is a mistake, the answer is often hidden, since the error usually puts one on completely the wrong track. It is therefore extremely important not to be trapped by one’s mistaken ideas.” - p 94
</p>
<p>
“With the double helix clearly in view, the next problem was, what did it do - how did it influence the rest of the cell? We already knew the answer in outline. Genes determined the amino acid sequence of proteins. Because the backbone of the nucleic acid structure appeared so regular we assumed, correctly, that it was the base sequence that carried this information. Since the DNA was in the nucleus of the cell and since protein synthesis seemed to take place outside the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, we imagined that a copy of each active gene had to be sent to the cytoplasm. As there was plenty of RNA there, and no apparent trace of DNA, we assumed that this messenger was RNA. It was easy enough to see how a stretch o DNA would make an RNA copy - a simple base-pairing mechanism could do the trick - but it was less easy to see how the resulting messenger RNA could direct protein synthesis, especially as very little was then known about this latter process.” - p 117
</p>
<p>
“We knew there were about a couple dozen different kinds of amino acids - the little units from which protein chains were made - yet there were only <em>four</em> different kinds of bases in DNA and RNA. One solution would be to read the nucleic acid sequence two bases at a time. This would yield only sixteen (4 x 4) possibilities, which seemed too few. Another alternative was to read them <em>three</em> at a time. This would give sixty-four (4 x 4 x 4) possible combinations of the four bases A, T, G, and C. This seemed too many.” - p 117

There are more videos in this lecture series. I just watched the first one. Some things I learned: - rereading is the first indication you’re reading something in a way it wasn’t written - Go through papers in a field and circle the words that make them seem important. Fields have different “important words” lists. Whenever you write, see if you can find a bunch in your own writing; if not, sprinkle some in from the list. - New or original knowledge doesn’t matter. It must be <em>valuable</em>. - Writing isn’t meant to be preserved forever. Think of knowledge not as a monotonically increasing function but as a temporal instance of what people think is important. Writing is important insofar as it moves that temporal instance forward.

</p>
<p>
<em>Preface</em>
</p>
<p>
Thesis: QM isn’t about matter, energy, waves, or particles. It’s about information and probabilities and observables, and how they relate to each other.
</p>
<p>
QM might be counterintuitive, but we should ask: <em>where</em> did my intuition go wrong such that I wouldn’t be able to intuit or predict QM?
</p>
<p>
It might be the case that QM is inherently ununderstandable. Aaronson says if that’s true, he <em>doesn’t care</em> about QM. He’ll go do something else. It’s like flunking him without telling him how to improve or even telling him that he can’t improve.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the book’s perspective on this: QM is a generalization of the laws of probability that use the 2-norm instead of the 1-norm, and complex numbers. We can study it <em>completely independently</em> from its use in physics. Whiel QM was invented to explain physical phenomena, <em>now</em> we can explain it as part of the history of ideas in math, logic, computing, and philosophy about the limits of the knowable.
</p>
<p>
<em>Chapter 1: Atoms and the void</em>
</p>
<p>
Democritus writes a dialogue between Intellect and Senses:
</p>
<p>
Intellect: &gt; By convention there is sweetness, by convention bitterness, by convention color, <em>in reality</em> only atoms and the void.
</p>
<p>
Senses: &gt; Foolish Intellect! Do you seek to overthrow us, while it is from us that you take your evidence?
</p>
<p>
I think I’m missing a few layers of detail but I think Aaronson is says this is a metaphor for QM because: QM says atoms and the void evolve unitarily but measuring collapses this. This measurement part is weird: what even counts as a measurement? Removing it would make things cleaner from a physics standpoint. But we have <em>data</em> so we know this isn’t true and that measurements exist ie Nature does unitary evolution until someone looks and then it does something else!
</p>
<p>
We can classify interpretations of QM by what they say about the idea of “putting yourself in a coherent superposition.” Copenhagen sweeps this under the rug - there’s a line separating quantum systems and measurements. Many-world and Bohmian mechanics try to answer the question.
</p>
<p>
<em>Chapter 2: Sets</em>
</p>
<p>
Math is the foundation of thought, and set theory is the foundation of math.
</p>
<p>
The language we’ll use to talk about sets is called first-order logic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rules of first-order logic</strong>: the rules all govern how to construct sentences that are <em>valid</em> ie tautologically true.

<strong>Peano axioms for nonnegative integers in first-order logic</strong>

The nonnegative integers are a <em>model</em> for the Peano axioms, ie some set that satisfies the axioms.

<p>
Cardinalities: all the finite ones (natural numbers), then <span class="math inline">ℵ_0</span> (aleph zero).
</p>
<p>
Natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers have cardinality <span class="math inline">ℵ_0</span>. (We say two sets have the same cardinality if there’s a one-to-one mapping.)
</p>
<p>
There are infinitely many infinities. PROOF:
</p>
<p>
Suppose we have an infinite set <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. We’ll create set <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> such that <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> has more elements than <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>.
</p>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> be the set of all subsets of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, guaranteed to exist by Power Set axiom. Suppose we can map each <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∈ <em>A</em></span> to an element <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) ∈ <em>B</em></span>.
</p>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ⊆ <em>A</em></span> consist of <em>every</em> <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> not contained in <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>)</span>.
</p>
<p>
Since <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> is a subset of <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ⊆ <em>B</em></span>, which means that <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) = <em>S</em></span> for some <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∈ <em>S</em></span> can’t be true because <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) = <em>S</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∈ <em>S</em></span>, but <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> contains only elements <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> such that <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∉ <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>)</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∉ <em>S</em></span> can’t be true because then <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∉ <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>)</span> so it should be in <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>.
</p>
<p>
Contradiction. So <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> must have larger cardinality than <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>.
</p>
<p>
Define <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span> to be greater than all the natural numbers. What comes after <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span>? Well <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em> + 1</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em> + 2</span>, …, <span class="math inline">2<em>ω</em></span>, …, <span class="math inline">3<em>ω</em></span>, …, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup>2</sup></span>, …, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup>3</sup></span>, …, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup>2</sup></span>, …, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup>3</sup></span>, …, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup><em>ω</em></sup></span>, …, <span class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sup><em>ω</em><sup><em>ω</em></sup></sup></span>, …
</p>
<p>
These are called the ordinal numbers. ANy set of ordinal numbers has a first ordinal number that comes after everything in the set.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the ordinal numbers are well-ordered, which means every subset of of a set of ordinal numbers has a minimum element.
</p>
<p>
Consider the set of all ordinal numbers with countably many predecessors. The successor to this set must have a cardinality of predecessors that is uncountable, or it would have been in the set. Call this cardinality <span class="math inline">ℵ_1</span>.
</p>
<p>
By this logic, the set of cardinalities is also well-ordered.
</p>
<p>
Starting with <span class="math inline">ℵ_0</span>, what is the next cardinality? Well we know how to construct <span class="math inline">ℵ_1</span> from above.<br /> What about cardinality of <em>sets</em> of all integers, <span class="math inline">2<sup>ℵ_0</sup></span>? This is the set of all real numbers.
</p>
<p>
Are they equal? This was Hilbert’s first problem in 1900.
</p>
<p>
Cantor believed there was no intermediate infinity. He conjectured the Continuum Hypothesis: there is no set <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> such that
</p>
<p>
<span class="math inline">ℵ_0 &lt; |<em>S</em>| &lt; 2<sup>ℵ_0</sup></span>.
</p>
<p>
There’s another statement that hasn’t been proved from ZF axioms: the Axiom of Choice, which states if you have a (possibly infinite) set of sets, then it’s possible to form a new set choosing one item from each set. The Banach-Tarski paradox uses this axiom to prove it’s possible to cut a solid sphere into finite pieces and reconstruct them to create a solid sphere 1000 times bigger.
</p>
<p>
The heart of why the Axiom of Choice has such huge consequences is that it asserts certain sets exist without providing a rule for constructing them.
</p>
<p>
AC is equal the statement that every set can be well-ordered. Here’s why:
</p>
<p>
Well-ordering -&gt; AC: we can well-order our set of sets then pick the item in each set with lowest ordinal.
</p>
<p>
AC -&gt; well-ordering: for all proper subsets <span class="math inline"><em>B</em> ⊂ <em>A</em></span>, use AC to pick an element <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>) ∈ <em>A</em> − <em>B</em></span>. Then we can well-order by: - <span class="math inline"><em>s</em>_0 = <em>f</em>() ∈ <em>A</em></span> - <span class="math inline"><em>s</em>_1 = <em>f</em>(<em>s</em>_0) ∈ <em>A</em> − <em>s</em>_0</span> - <span class="math inline"><em>s</em>_2 = <em>f</em>(<em>s</em>_0, <em>s</em>_1) ∈ <em>A</em> − <em>s</em>_0 − <em>s</em>_1</span> - …
</p>
<p>
Even if <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is infinite, it must have some fixed infinite cardinality, so this ordering can’t go on forever. (Why not?)
</p>
<p>
There are difficulties with CH.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we want a union of open intervals that cover every rational point. Does the sum of lengths of intervals have to be infinite? No! The rational numbers are countable, so we can enumerate them and then surround them with interval <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em>/2<sup><em>i</em></sup></span> for the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th rational number. (How does this use CH?)
