<p>“I think few people realize exactly what a failure all this <em>theoretical</em> work on the genetic code turned out to be.” - p15</p>
<p>“The most important theme of the book is natural selection. As I explain, it is this basic mechanism that makes biology different from all other sciences… Anyone can grasp the mechnism itself, though remarkably few people actually do so.” - p 16</p>
<p>“Natural selection almost always builds on what went before, so that a basically simple process becomes encumbered with many subsidiary gadgets… It is the resulting complexity that makes biological organisms so hard to unscramble. Biology is thus very different from physics. The basic laws of physics can usually be expressed in exact mathematical form, and they are probably the same throughout the universe.” - p 16</p>
<p>“All this can make it difficult for a physicist to contribute to biological research. Elegance and a deep simplicity are useful guides in physics, but in biology such intellectual tools can be very misleading.” - p 16</p>
<p>“I myself knew very little biology till I was over thirty, since my first degree was in physics. It took me a little time to adjust to the rather different way of thinking necessary in biology. It was almost as if one had to be born again. Yet such a transition is not as difficult as all that and is certainly well worth the effort.” - p 16</p>

<p>“If I had a fault, it was that if I could grasp something easily, I believed I had already understood it thoroughly.” - p 19</p>
<p>“I have no doubt, as will emerge later, that this loss of faith in Christian religion and my growing attachment to science have played a dominant part in my scientific career, not so much on a day-to-day basis but in the choice of what I have considered interesting and important… What could be more foolish than to base one’s entire view of life on ideas that, however plausible at the time, now appear to be quite erroneous?” - p 20</p>
<p>“Much later, when I read Linus Pauling’s <em>General Chemistry</em>, I found it enthralling. Even so I have never tried to master inorganic chemistry, and my knowledge of organic chemistry is still very patchy.” - p 21</p>
<p>“Andrade put me onto the dullest problem imaginable, the determination of the viscosity of water, under pressure, between 100 and 150 degrees C… What I <em>had</em> acquired, however indirectly, was the hubris of the physicist, the feeling that physics as a discipline was highly successful, so why should not other sciences do likewise? I believe this did help me when, after the war, I eventually switched to biophysics.” - p 22</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>“Only gradually did I realize that this lack of qualification could be an advantage. By the time most scientists have reached age thirty they are trapped by their own expertise. They have invested so much effort in one particular field that it is often extremely difficult, at that time in their careers, to make a radical change.” - p 24</p>
<p>“I had discovered the gossip test - what you are really interested in is what you gossip about.” - p 25</p>
<p>“The main advantage was that the work was not too demanding and left me plenty of time for extensive reading in my new subject.” - p 30</p>
<p>“Many proteins, if heated briefly to the boiling point of water, became denatured, as if they had unfolded so that their three-dimensional structure had been partly destroyed. When this happened the denatured protein usually lost its catalytic or other function, strongly suggesting that the function of such a protein <em>depended on its exact three-dimensional structure</em>.” - p 52</p>
<p>“As a beginner in research, still almost an amateur… I think at the back of my mind was the idea that science was an occupation for gentlemen. Incredible as it may seem, I had not realized that for many it was a highly competitive career.” - p 63</p>
<p>“The existing textbooks usually used a step-by-step method, based largely on Bragg’s law and the historical development of the subject. To someone like myself this only made it more difficult and certainly more tedious, since an elementary method often arouses deeper questions in the learner and these worries can impede one’s progress in learning. It is often better, at least for brighter pupils, to go straight to the advanced treatment and try to get over the more powerful formalism while at the same time attempting to provide some insight into what is going on.” - p 65</p>
<p>“Meanwhile Bragg had independently thought about it. Whereas I had gotten bogged down, he made rapid progress. He boldly assumed that one could approximate the shape by an ellipsoid – a particularly simple type of distorted sphere. Then he looked at what little was known of the crystals of hemoglobin of other species of animal, on the assumption that all types of hemoglobin molecules were likely to have about the same shape. Moreover, he was not disturbed if the data did not <em>exactly</em> fit his model, since it was unllikely that the molecule was <em>exactly</em> an ellipsoid. In otherwords, he made bold, simplifying assumptions; looked at as wide a range of data as possible; and was critical but not pernickety, as I had been, about the fit between his model and experimental facts. He arrived at a shape that we now know is not a bad approximation to the molecule’s real shape… The result was not of first-class importance, if only because the method was indirect and needed confirmation by more direct methods, but it was a revelation to me as to how to do scientific research.” - p 67</p>
<p>“There was some justification for his annoyance. A group of people engaged in a difficult and somewhat uncertain undertaking are not helped by persistent negative criticism from one of their number. It destroys the mood of confidence necessary to carry through such a hazardous enterprise to a successful conclusion. But equally it is useless to persist in a course of action that is bound to fail, especially if alternate methods exist.” - p 71</p>
<p>“It is interesting to note the curious mental attitude of scientists working on ‘hopeless’ subjects. Contrary to what one might at first expect, they are all buoyed up with irrepressible optimism. I believe there is a simple explanation for this. Anyone without such optimism simply leaves the field and takes up some other line of work. Only the optimists remain. So one has the curious phenomenon that workers in subjects in which the prize is big but the prospects of success very small always appear very optimistic. And this in spite of the fact that, although plenty appears to be going on, they never seem to get appreciably nearer their goal.” - p 72</p>
