<p>“I think few people realize exactly what a failure all this <em>theoretical</em> work on the genetic code turned out to be.” - p15</p>
<p>“The most important theme of the book is natural selection. As I explain, it is this basic mechanism that makes biology different from all other sciences… Anyone can grasp the mechnism itself, though remarkably few people actually do so.” - p 16</p>
<p>“Natural selection almost always builds on what went before, so that a basically simple process becomes encumbered with many subsidiary gadgets… It is the resulting complexity that makes biological organisms so hard to unscramble. Biology is thus very different from physics. The basic laws of physics can usually be expressed in exact mathematical form, and they are probably the same throughout the universe.” - p 16</p>
<p>“All this can make it difficult for a physicist to contribute to biological research. Elegance and a deep simplicity are useful guides in physics, but in biology such intellectual tools can be very misleading.” - p 16</p>
<p>“I myself knew very little biology till I was over thirty, since my first degree was in physics. It took me a little time to adjust to the rather different way of thinking necessary in biology. It was almost as if one had to be born again. Yet such a transition is not as difficult as all that and is certainly well worth the effort.” - p 16</p>

<p>“If I had a fault, it was that if I could grasp something easily, I believed I had already understood it thoroughly.” - p 19</p>
<p>“I have no doubt, as will emerge later, that this loss of faith in Christian religion and my growing attachment to science have played a dominant part in my scientific career, not so much on a day-to-day basis but in the choice of what I have considered interesting and important… What could be more foolish than to base one’s entire view of life on ideas that, however plausible at the time, now appear to be quite erroneous?” - p 20</p>
<p>“Much later, when I read Linus Pauling’s <em>General Chemistry</em>, I found it enthralling. Even so I have never tried to master inorganic chemistry, and my knowledge of organic chemistry is still very patchy.” - p 21</p>
<p>“Andrade put me onto the dullest problem imaginable, the determination of the viscosity of water, under pressure, between 100 and 150 degrees C… What I <em>had</em> acquired, however indirectly, was the hubris of the physicist, the feeling that physics as a discipline was highly successful, so why should not other sciences do likewise? I believe this did help me when, after the war, I eventually switched to biophysics.” - p 22</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>“Only gradually did I realize that this lack of qualification could be an advantage. By the time most scientists have reached age thirty they are trapped by their own expertise. They have invested so much effort in one particular field that it is often extremely difficult, at that time in their careers, to make a radical change.” - p 24</p>
<p>“I had discovered the gossip test - what you are really interested in is what you gossip about.” - p 25</p>
<p>“The main advantage was that the work was not too demanding and left me plenty of time for extensive reading in my new subject.” - p 30</p>
