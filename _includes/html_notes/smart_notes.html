<p><strong>An External Brain.</strong></p>
<p>The Zettelkasten is a note-taking system. Notes are distilled into their individual ideas, and each idea is paraphrased on one side of an index card. Index cards are placed in a container so that related cards are located next to each other.</p>
<p>Our brains are unpredictable and mysterious. Suppose we wanted to build a better brain. Here’s an attempt at creating a communicating partner with the Zettelkasten that has brain-like features:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Linking of ideas</em>: We want to strengthen ideas by relating them to other ideas. The Zettelkasten accomplishes this by giving each zettel (index card) its own <em>unique, permanent</em> ID. This allows any zettel to reference another related zettel just by writing down the ID.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Arbitrary branching</em>: Ideas are most valuable when surrounded by the proper context, which isn’t always the source you first encountered the idea in. The Zettelkasten achieves this by making the ID of each card alphanumeric: to place a new card behind a related existing card with the ID 22, give the new card an ID of 23. If 23 already exists, use 22a. This allows for arbitrarily deep dives into any topic without premeditation on how to organize the information in a useful way.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Nonlinear and unordered</em>: Any sort of system with an order is doomed because it necessarily loses its functionality once it becomes very dense. There’s no way to predict which subtopics we’ll intensely study years down the road so any organizational structure which imposes a hierarchy of folders and dividers eventually gets to a point where choosing where to place information is harder than actually learning the information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Complexity only on the content level</em>: Our brains store an unfathomable expanse of knowledge without getting wrapped up in organizational details. The Zettelkasten’s simple structure allows us to mimic this feature. if we think something is important, we can defer to putting it in the Zettelkasten. If it’s important, other zettels will link to and from it. It it isn’t important, it’ll get lost in isolation. Both scenarios are fine (as long as the latter occurs in minority) which prevents paralysis of indecision of whether/where to add information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Higher-level thinking</em>: The Zettelkasten has economies of scale unlike other note-taking systems which become exponentially more cumbersome with the number of notes. At first, the Zettelkasten will just be a repository of information, but after several months, once it develops a critical mass of information, the Zettelkasten develops arguments and ideas on its own through the interconnectivity and new contexts of ideas. This requires a lot of effort, especially at first, to avoid the system from just becoming an archive of notes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A Better Brain.</strong></p>
<p>It would help if our external brain could also help us get work done:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Easy to work in</em>: We shouldn’t have to force ourselves to be productive or work harder. Self-control is a finite resource that is depleting when used on tasks we’re conflicted on doing [1]. Tasks are easiest to get done when they’re well-defined, meaningful, and interesting. Here’s a way to monitor resistance and avoid it: count the number of zettels you write in a day. This is a reliable metric of productivity since each zettel represents a distilled idea.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trust</em>: Any note-taking system needs to be trusted to hold what it’s important in an easily accessible way. The Zettelkasten ensures important ideas have many branches and a high volume of cards. It’s even beneficial to not commit everything in the Zettelkasten to memory: if you memorize a zettel, when you come across it, you won’t truly read the zettel but will think of what you remember it saying. Instead if you haven’t memorized, when you come across a zettel, you’ll read the full card and organically think of new thoughts that relate to it based on some other information you’ve recently read.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Atomic</em>: Generalizable ideas are where breakthroughs come from. Being able to truly explain the essence of an idea or proof demonstrates mastery of the topic and increases its usefulness because now you can try to apply that model of thinking to other topics. This means we should write zettels so we can understand even after forgetting exact original context.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Quick, reliable feedback</em>: Feynman said “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” We need accurate and quick feedback to keep us motivated and to accurately depict our current level of understanding. One way to achieve this is to use the following method for learning: write fleeting notes in a common notebook, then rewrite the important notes while keeping track of bibliographical information, and at the end of the day condense the important ideas into zettels to insert into the Zettelkasten. The key point is to paraphrase information in your own words at each step: multiple passes makes it more likely we’ll catch ourselves when we’re bullshitting understanding. Making the Zettelkasten the final step ensures that only the truly important ideas we can explain ourselves are inserted.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Backed up</em>: The problem with a physical system is that we can’t easily back up our work. One solution is to append another step to the process stated above: once a month, go through the Zettelkasten and write up an article that relates ideas from one big cluster.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned.</strong></p>
<p>From personally using a zettelkasten, I’ve noticed the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Minimizing barriers to adding a zettel is essential (<em>Complexity only on the content level</em>). I’ve found thinking of the cards as a flat ordering makes me less nervous about adding a card. To this end, I think a decimal ordering is better than an alphanumeric one. If the card ordering is flat, the numbers 22, 22A, 23 should mean the same thing as 1, 2, 3. The problem with this is in adding a card between 22 and 22A. What now? 22-A? I’ve actually noticed I get a little nervous when placing a card in a position where I can’t add a card before it. A decimal system resolves this. We can have 22, 22.1, 23. Now a card after 22.1 would be 22.2. A card between 22 and 22.1 would be 22.01.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Here’s my preferred decimal system: when adding a zettel between 22 and 23, for example, I give that card ID 22.5. This way there’s less pressure to add a zettel before it (that would be ID 22.4) and adding one after is simple as well. There isn’t any bias toward adding before or after. Once I finish the tenth digits and want to add a card between 22 and 22.1, I’ll give it ID 22.05.</p></li>
<li><p>One caveat to this: when I’m taking notes in a structured order (while reading the <em>Sequences</em> at <em>LessWrong</em>, for example), the first card between 22 and 23 will have ID 22.1. This keeps ID numbers shorter when I know I’m more likely to proceed in a sequential order.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I’m not sure whether the <em>Atomic</em> restriction is useful. I’m using 3x5 index cards to force myself to break ideas up into their individual parts, but I’ve found that this also leads to many ideas taking up multiple cards, which I don’t like. An especially annoying manifestation of this is when proofs span multiple cards. I’m considering switching to 4x6 index cards, though I’ll try this on some other subject I want to learn instead of just rewriting all my QC zettels on 4x6 index cards. I can still be atomic with 4x6 index cards but it’ll feel like a waste to have a lot of whitespace on some cards.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of just the names is important so I can see every card that exists easily instead of thumbing through everything. It also gives a different important perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping backups is really important since this is a physical system and is supposed to achieve economies of scale years down the road. Since the system is nonlinear, I’m going to add two slanted lines in the bottom right corner of each card. When I take a photo of the zettel and upload it to Dropbox, I’ll change the left slanted line to an X, and when I add the zettel ID and title to a Markdown list, I’ll change the right slanted line to an X. This way I know which cards I haven’t backed up.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t like using too many different colors on the cards, but I noticed that using blue pen for all the IDs makes reading cards much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Since I’m keeping a master list of zettels, I need to update it every now and then. My original strategy for doing this was to go through all the zettels and check the bottom right corner to see if the zettel was entered into the master list. This is starting to become unwieldy because of how many zettels I have. From now on, I think I’ll keep any new zettels I add on their side, so that they stick up from the rest. This makes it easy to locate the ones I need to input into the master list and shouldn’t be annoying because I intent to update the master list often anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>I originally planned on doing multiple run-throughs of material before adding it to the zettelkasten. I wanted to use a notebook, periodically update Zotero with my notes throughout the day, and then update the zettelkasten once a day. I don’t think this is working well. A better method seems to only use a notebook to make quick notes for understanding for several days, then spend an entire day to review my notebook notes by uploading them atomically to Zotero, and then put everything in the zettelkasten.</p></li>
<li><p>I find that I’m constantly checking the Table of Contents markdown file. For some reason, this was making me nervous because I kept feeling like I should incorporate a better search method, which would necessitate moving to a digital system. This is ridiculous; I’m pretty sure my brain was looking for some way to avoid doing the actual work of making zettels and reviewing them, so it decided I should worry more about optimizing the form of my system instead of the content. Checking the digital ToC is <em>fine</em>. In fact, Luhmann constantly made zettels as mini-ToC for certain subjects within his notes. I should try doing this. The solution to this problem of feeling bad about checking the ToC is the same as the solution to most problems people have with the zettelkasten: try to make it a habit to <em>live inside</em> the zettelkasten. Get a feel for its structure and unique grooves.</p></li>
<li><p>I find copying notes from one medium to another boring, especially copying notes to and from Zotero. Zotero is a terrible system for notes and has little math support. It was so annoying to work in it. The solution <em>isn’t</em> a better note-taking system to replace it! I wanted to keep Zotero to keep track of my references and to force myself to rephrase things in my own words one more time. But after a little hthinking, I realize I could just write the sources of a zettel on the back of the zettel since I wasn’t using that space for most of my zettels.</p></li>
<li><p>Another reason I kept subconsciously wanting to move to a digital system was because I was afraid of losing my physical zettels somehow and needing a backup. This really isn’t a huge problem though. If I truly do live inside the system, I’ll remember most of the important content. If some terrible situation causes my zettelkasten to be destroyed or lost, I can start a new one and pick up where I left off.</p></li>
<li><p>I think a good way to get into the habit of living inside the zettelkasten is to make a daily ritual of rewriting the 5 worst zettels in the zettelkasten. By rewrite, I mean even splitting up a zettel is okay (because I find that I tend to think of the task of rewriting as simply making my handwriting better and not thinking about the content in the card I’m rewriting). Essentially, everyday find a way to create 5 brand new zettels from information already inside the zettelkasten.</p></li>
<li><p>I just rewrote my zettels with a different numbering system that has a 53-alphabet instead of a 10-alphabet. I was trying to decide which zettels would get a single alphabet (like A for “Table of Contents”, C for “Postulate 2 of QM”, etc), but then I realized if I really wanted to embrace the idea of flat ordering and non-categorization, I should just choose an order for the zettels and just number them incrementally. Like A, B, C, … without caring about their content and branching. I think this is a great idea.</p></li>
