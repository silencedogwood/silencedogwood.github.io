<h4 id="chapter-1-human-nature">Chapter 1: Human Nature</h4>
<p>“This book is an inquiry into the nature of that human nature. Its theme is tat it is impossible to understand human nature without understanding how it evolved, and it is impossible to understand how it evolved without understanding how human sexuality evolved. For the central theme of our evolution has been sexual.” - p 10</p>
<p>“Everything can be inherited except sterility. None of your direct ancestors died childless… if we are to understand how human nature evolved, the very core of our inquiry must be reproduction.” -p 11</p>
<p><strong>Of Nature and Nurture</strong></p>
<p>“For those who protest that human nature did not evolve, but was invented <em>de novo</em>, by something called ‘culture,’ I have more hope. I think I can persuade you that our views are compatible. Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution.” -p 12</p>
<p>“Inside my skull is a brain that was designed to exploit the conditions of an African savanna between 3 million and 100,000 years ago… there is little reason to believe that the gray matter inside the skull changed much, either. For a start, 100,000 years is only three thousand generations, a mere eye blink in evolution, equivalent to a day and a half in the life of bacteria.” -p 14</p>
<p><strong>The Individual in Society</strong></p>
<p>“It is one of the remarkable things about the human race that no two people are identical… Every idiot can be father or mother to a genius – and vice versa… Indeed, this uniqueness goes further in human beings than in any other animal.” -p 15</p>
<p>“Every human being has two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so on. A mere thirty generations back – in roughly, A.D. 1066 – you had more than a billion direct ancestors in the <em>same</em> generation (<span class="math inline">2<sup>30</sup></span>). Since there were fewer than a billion people alive at that time in the whole world, many of them were your ancestors two or three times over. If, like me, you are of British descent, the chances are that almost all of the few million Britons alive in 1066, including King Harold, William the Conqueror, a random serving wench, and the meanest vassal (but excluding all the well-behaved monks and nuns), are your direct ancestors.” -p 16</p>
<p>“Little more than three thousand generations back, all our ancestors lived in Africa, a few million simple hunter-gatherers, completely modern in physiology and psychology. As a result, the genetic differences between the average members of different races are actually tiny.” -p 16</p>
<p><strong>Ours to Reason Why?</strong></p>
<p>“We human beings find the notion of engineering design quite easy to grasp and have little difficulty seeing the analogy with the design of an eye. But we seem to find it harder to grasp the idea of ‘designed’ behavior, mainly because we assume that purposeful behavior is evidence of conscious choice. An example might help to clarify what I mean. There is a little wasp that injects its eggs into whitefly aphids, where they grow into new wasps by eating the whitefly from the inside out. Distressing but true. If one of these wasps, upon poking its tail into a whitefly, discovers that the aphid is already occupied by a young wasp, then she does something that seems remarkably intelligent: she withholds sperm from the egg she is about to lay and lays an unfertilized egg inside the wasp larva that is inside the whitefly. (It is a peculiarity of wasps and ants that unfertilized eggs develop into males, while all fertilized ones develop into females.) The ‘intelligent’ thing that the mother wasp has done is to recognize that there is less to eat inside an already-occupied whitefly than in virgin territory. Her egg will therefore grow into a small, stunted wasp. And in her species males are small, females large. So it was ‘clever’ of her to ‘choose’ to make her offspring male when she ‘knew’ it was going to be small. But of course this is nonsense. She was not ‘clever’; she did not ‘choose’ and she ‘knew’ not what she did. She was a miniscule wasp with a handful of brain cells and asolutely no possibility of conscious thought. She was an automation, carrying out the simple instructions of her neural program: <code>if whitefly occipied, withhold sperm</code>. Her program had been designed by natural selection over millions of years: wasps that inherited a tendency to withhold sperm when they found their prey already occupied had more successful offspring than those that did not. Yet in exactly the same way that natural selection had ‘designed’ an eye, as if for the ‘purpose’ of seeing, so natural selection had produced behavior that seemed designed to suit the wasp’s purposes.” - p 18</p>
<p>“In physics, there is no great difference between a why question and a how question. How does the earth go around the sun? By gravitational attraction. Why does the earth go around the sun? Because of gravity. Evolution, however, causes biology to be a very different game because it includes contingent history.” - p 19</p>
<p><strong>Of Conflict and Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>“Every creature on earth is in a Red Queen chess tournament with its parasites (or hosts), its predators (or prey), and, above all, its mate.” - p 21</p>
<h4 id="chapter-2-the-enigma">Chapter 2: The Enigma</h4>
<p>“Why must a baby be the product of two people? Whynot three, or one? <em>Need there be a reason at all?</em>” - p 26</p>
<p>“In 1858, the year Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace gave the first plausible account of a mechanism for evolution, the Victorian brand of optimism known as ‘progress’ was in its prime. It is hardly surprising that Darwin and Wallace were immediately interpreted as having given succor to the god of progress. Evolution’s immediate popularity (and it was popular) owed much to the fact that it was misunderstood as a theory of steady progress from amoeba to man, a ladder of self-improvement.” - p 27 - I think this is my reason for evolution…</p>
<p><strong>Pregnant Virgins</strong></p>
<p>“For people, sex is the only way to have babies, and that, plainly enough, is its purpose. It was only in the last half of the nineteenth century that anybody saw a problem with this. The problem was that there seemed to be all sorts of better ways of reproducing. Microscopic animals split in two. Willow trees grow from cuttings. Dandelions produce seeds that are clones of themselves. Virgin greenfly give birth to virgin young that are already pregnant with other virgins.” - p 27</p>
<p>“Lots of creatures do not have sex at all or do it in some generations and not others. The virgin greenfly’s great-great-granddaughter, at the end of the summer, will be sexual: She will mate with a male greenfly and have young that are mixtures of their parents. Why does she bother? For an accident, sex seems to have hung on with remarkable tenacity.” - p 28</p>
<p><strong>Of Sex and Free Trade</strong></p>
<p>“A normal human being has two copies of each of 30,000 genes in every cell in his or her body. The total complement of 60,000 human genes is called the ‘genome,’ and the genes live on twenty-three pairs of ribbonlike objects called ‘chromosomes.’ When a man impregnates a woman, each one of his sperm contains one copy of each gene, 30,000 in all, on twenty-three chromosomes. These are added to the 30,000 single genes on twenty-three chromosomes in the woman’s egg to make a complete human embryo with 30,000 pairs of genes and twenty-three pairs of chromosomes.” - p 28</p>
<p>“Meiosis [is] the procedure by which the male selects the genes that will go into a sperm or the female selects the genes that will go into an egg. The man may choose either the 30,000 genes he inherited from his father or the 75,000 he inherited from his mother or more likely, a mixture. During meiosis something peculiar happens. Each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes is laid alongside its opposite number. Chunks of one set are swapped with chunks of the other in a procedure called ‘recombination.’ One whole set is then passed on to the offspring to be married with a set from another parent - a procedure known as ‘outcrossing.’” - p 29</p>
<p>“Sex is recombination plus outcrossing; this mixing of genes is its principal feature. The consequence is that the baby gets a thorough mixture of its four grandparents’ genes (because of recombination) and its two parents’ genes (because of outcrossing).” - p 29</p>
<p>“Put this way, sex immediately becomes detached from reproduction. A creature could borrow another’s genes at any stage in its life. Indeed, that is exactly what bacteria do. They simply hook up with each other like refueling bombers, pass a few genes through the pipe, and go their separate ways. Reproduction they do later, by splitting in half.” - p 29</p>
<p>“[Weismann said sex] speeds up evolution… The Weismann logic was profoundly flawed. It seems to treat evolution as some kind of imperative, as if evolving were what species exist to do - as if evolving were a goal imposed on existence. This is, of course, nonsense. Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a <em>directionless</em> process that sometimes makes an animal’s descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this. But nobody has told the coelacanth, a fish that lives off Madagascar and looks exactly like its ancestors of 300 million years ago, that it has broken some law by not ‘evolving.’ <em>The notion that evolution simply cannot go fast enough, and its corollary that a coelacanth is a failure because it did not become a human being, is easily refuted.</em> As Darwin noticed, mankind has intervened dramatically to speed up evolution, producing hundreds of breeds of dogs, from chihuahuas to St. Bernards, in an evolutionary eye blink. <em>That alone is evidence that evolution was not going as fast as it could.</em> Indeed, the coelacanth, far from being a flop, is rather a success. It has stayed the same - a design that persists without innovation, like a Volkswagen beetle. Evolving is not a goal but a means to solving a problem.” - p 30</p>
<p><strong>Mankind’s Greatest Rival is Mankind</strong></p>
<p>“The fallacy persists in the way many laymen speak of evolution. We talk blithely among ourselves about evolution being a question of the ‘survival of the species.’ We imply that species compete with each other, that Darwin’s ‘struggle for existence’ is between dinosaurs and mammals, or between rabbits and foxes, or between men and neanderthals.” - p 31</p>
<p>“Suppose the individual is a tigress whose territory has recently been invaded by another tigress. Does she welcome the intruder and discuss how best they can cohabit the territory, sharing prey? No, she fights her to the death, which from the point of view of the species is unhelpful.” - p 32</p>
<p><strong>The Rediscovery of the Individual</strong></p>
<p>[George Williams wrote <em>Adaptation and Natural Selection</em> to explain why the group selection view of evolution was wrong.]</p>
<p>“[Williams] knew full well that individual animals often cooperate and that human society is not a ruthless free-for-all. But he also saw that cooperation is nearly always between close relatives… where altruists help their relatives, they are helping those who share some of their genes, including whatever genes had caused them to be altruistic. So without any conscious intention on the part of individuals, such genes spread. But Williams realized that there was one troubling exception to this pattern: sex. The traditional explanation for sex, the Vicar of Bray theory, was essentially group selectionist. It demanded that an individual altruistically share its genes with those of another individual when breeding because if it did not, the species would not innovate and would, a few hundred thousand years later, be outcompeted by other species that did. Sexual species, it said, were better off than asexual species.” - p 33</p>
<p>“Williams was inclined to conclude that perhaps his logic was good, but for animals like us the practical problems were simply insurmountable. In other words, getting from being sexual to being asexual would indeed confer advantages, but it would be just too difficult to achieve.” - p 36</p>
<p>“Yet this argument for sex is pretty unconvincing because quite a few animals and plants have abandoned sex or have it only occasionally… Water fleas can turn sex on and off again, which seems to prove that it has some immediate purpose beyond helping evolution to happen. It is worth an individual water flea’s while to have sex at least in certain seasons. So we are left again with an enigma. Sex serves the species but at the expense of the individual. Individuals could abandon sex and rapidly outcompete their sexual rivals. But they do not. Sex must therefore in some mysterious manner ‘pay its way’ for the individual as well as for the species. How?” - p 36</p>
<p><strong>The Master-Copy Theory</strong></p>
<p>One argument for sex is that it was invented to repair genes. When DNA is damaged, special enzymes notice and fix it by referencing its complementary attached base. But what happens if the entire pair breaks in one place? Sex provides a template of what the gene used to look like via outcrossing from another creature or recombination in the same creature.</p>
<p>Ridley doesn’t like this:</p>
<p>“If diploid creatures were to indulge in a little recombination between chromosomes every time their cells divided as the body grew, there would be plenty of opportunity for repair. But they do not. They recombine their genes only at the final peculiar division called meiosis that leads to the formation of an egg or a sperm.” - p 40</p>
<p><strong>Cameras and Ratchets</strong></p>
<p>Another theory is that sex facilites mutations.</p>
<p>“[Mutations] are acculumated at the rate of about one hundred per genome per generation in mammals. That is, your children will have one hundred differences from you and your spouse in their genes as a result of random copying errors by your enzymes or as a result of mutations in your ovaries or testicles caused by cosmic rays.” - p 40</p>
<p>The problem here is that the advantages of mutations are far too remote, occuring after generations of lucky mutations. Instead, the current theory is that sex is a way of reducing disastrous mutations.</p>
<p>“But why purge mutations in this way rather than correct more of them by better proofreading? Kondrashov has an ingenious explanation of why this makes sense. The cost of making proofreading mechanisms perfect gets rapidly higher as you get nearer to perfection… Meselson has come up with another explanation: ‘ordinary’ mutations that change one letter for another in the genetic code are fairly innocuous because they can be repaired, but <em>insertions</em> - whole chunks of DNA that jump into the middle of genes - cannot be reversed so easily. These ‘selfish’ insertions tend to spread like an infection, but sex defeats them, since sex segregates them into certain individuals whose deaths purge them from the population.” - p 44</p>
<p>Ridley doesn’t like this either:</p>
<p>“Kondrashov’s theory suffers from the same flaw as all genetic-repair theories and the Vicar of Bray himself: it works too slowly. Pitted against a clone of asexual individuals, a sexual population must inevitably be driven extinct by the clone’s greater productivity unless the clone’s genetic drawbacks can appear in time. It is a race against time. For how long? Lively… calculated that for every tenfold increase in population size, the advantage of sex is granted six more generations to show its effects or sex will lose the game. If there are a million individuals, sex has forty generations before it goes extinct; if a billion, it has eighty. Yet the genetic repair theories all require <em>thousands</em> of generations to do their work. Kondrashov’s is certainly the fastest theory, but it is probably not fast enough.” - p 45</p>
