<li>&quot;Try to spend most of your time thinking about the object level. If you’re spending more of your time <em>thinking about your own reasoning ability and competence</em> than you spend thinking about Japan’s interest rates and NGDP, or competing omega-6 vs. omega-3 metabolic pathways, you’re taking your eyes off the ball.</li>
<li>Less than a majority of the time: Think about how reliable authorities seem to be and should be expected to be, and how reliable you are – using your own brain to think about the reliability and failure modes of brains, since that’s what you’ve got. Try to be evenhanded in how you evaluate your own brain’s specific failures versus the specific failures of other brains. While doing this, take your own meta-reasoning at face value.&quot;</li>
