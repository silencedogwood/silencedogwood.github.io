<p>From <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oi873FWi6pHWxswSa">here</a>, “How to Beat Procrastination”, “My Algorithm for Beating Procrastination”, and “How to be Happy” are the ones I should read closely. I also need to follow up on the sources.</p>
<p>Lukeprog recommends <em>The Procrastination Equation</em> by Piers Steel, so I think I’ll read that and include lukeprog’s ideas too. Something I need to keep thinking about is lukeprog’s equation: <br /><span class="math display">$$ Motivation = \frac{Expectancy \times Value}{Impulsiveness \times Delay} $$</span><br /></p>
