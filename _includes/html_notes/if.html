<p><strong>Naive absolutes.</strong></p>
<p>What was most striking to me was Kipling’s way of effortlessly explaining the shortcomings of absolutes. Endorsing absolutes is easy to communicate; nuance is harder to do well succinctly. Some of it is logical: “make allowance for their doubting too” says believing in yourself doesn’t mean lying to yourself. Don’t forget that other people also have valuable experience behind their predictions. Some of it is politics from experience: “and yet don’t look too good, not talk too wise” is the first level <em>above</em> publicly being an idiot and publicly trying to look smart. Most people probably recognize the truth in it, but there isn’t really an advantage to <em>not trying</em> to look good or sound smart so people don’t do it.</p>
<p>There’s no really unique content in the poem. The cautions are all things I’ve seen played out in movies or books. And yet they’re almost certainly things I’m going to fail at responding to in my life.</p>
