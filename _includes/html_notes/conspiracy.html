<p>“Our tendency to shy away from this truth creates a profound ignorance of how things really work, and what it means to be strategic, to be powerful, and to <em>try</em> to shape events rather than simply be shaped by them.”</p>
<p>“There is a moment in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> when Jay Gatsby introduces Nick Carraway to Meyer Wolfsheim, mentioning offhandedly that he is the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. The idea staggers Gatsby’s idealistic young friend. Of course, Carraway knew the series had been thrown. But”if I had thought of it at all,&quot; he says, “I would have thought of it as a thing that merely <em>happened</em>, the end of some inevitable chain.” It was unbelievable to him then, as it is to us now, that a single person could have been responsible for changing the outcome of an event watched by some fifty million people.&quot;</p>
<p>“‘How did he happen to do that?’ he asks of the 1919 World Series plot. Gatsby answers: ‘He just saw the opportunity.’ Thiel had seen the opportunity where no one else had. He had taken it.”</p>
<p>“The 1919 World Series was fixed… with great skill and audacity by Arnold Rothstein, a Jewish gangster… Dwight Eisenhower eagerly followed the game as the scores came in via telegram, and like everyone else, never suspected a thing. He would remark years later that the revelation of the conspiracy that had thrown the series produced a profound change in his perspective about the world; it taught him never to trust in first appearances.”</p>
<p>“Rich Cohen once wrote that ‘one definition of evil is to fail to recognize the humanity in the other: to see a person as an object or tool, something to be put to use.’”</p>
<p>“It has been the great collective self-deception of Silicon Valley… that a person can engage in aggressive ‘disruption’… while pretending they are not at least similar to the ruthless capitalist barons of the previous centuries, that there is not a drop of Carnegie or Rockefeller or Vanderbilt DNA in the whole business.”</p>
<p>“One of the informal mottos of the libertarian community is ‘Don’t hurt people and don’t take their stuff.’”</p>
<p>“One can’t see one’s choices as simply selfish or personal or one would not have the strength to do what ultimately needs to be done… It became important for Thiel to see Gawker as singularly bad… Thiel has to make himself the lightning and the thunder that cannot be appealed against, just as all who would attempt to bend society to their will must do. To not do so would <em>imperil the entire operation they have just begun planning</em>. The Count of Monte Cristo would put it better: ‘What a fool I was not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself…’ William James knew that every man is ‘ready to be savage in some cause.’ The distinction, he said, between good people and bad people is ‘the choice of the cause.’”</p>
<p>“The paradox is that if one is too concerned about [the criticism or consequences of Ross Ulbricht building the Silk Road and ordering murders], one will never proceed.”</p>
<p>“The essential trait of the successful man is not only perseverance but almost a <em>perverse expectation of how difficult it is going to be</em>. It is having redundancies on top of redundancies, so you can absorb the losses you eventually incur.”</p>
<p>“History is, if anything, one long exercise in the triumph of secrets.”</p>
<p>“[Honesty and truth] do well for a child’s copybook, but a man who acts on them had better sheathe his sword forever.”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as an ‘almost secret’ conspiracy of any significance.”</p>
<p>“The less the conspirators know about the leader’s plan, the less likely they are to expose them — the less likely they are to undermine or question them. The less likely it is that the enemy will find out and block them.”</p>
<p>“In every conspiracy, there is temptation to talk, especially as you near your goal. The weight of silence and deceit begins to weigh on the participants… [Your friends speak] with such ease about their recent successes… yet you can say nothing.”</p>
<p>“‘Psychologically, there is this weird thing where you want to brag about these things that you’re not supposed to,’ Thiel would say to me. Freud explained the phenomenon a hundred years ago: ‘He that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his finger-tips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore…’ Just as rules are meant to be broken, it seems, secrets are meant to be shared.”</p>
<p>“The concealment of intentions is critical to countless worthwhile and [even] perfectly legetimate enterprises… even jouranlism… ‘If everybody put his cards on the table, the game would be over. The journalist must do his work in a kind of deliberate induced state of <em>moral anarchy</em>.’”</p>
<p>“‘The truest way to be deceived is to think oneself more knowing than others’ is La Rochefoucauld’s maxim.”</p>
<p>“‘I do think you <em>always want to think about</em>, you know, when this ultimately comes out. Is it defensible? And I think all the things we did were defensible. And so secrets aren’t necessarily forever. You have to live with it coming out at the end.’ Secrets are how real work is done.”</p>
<p>“Agents of conspiracy would be foolish to simply set it and forget it, to close themselves off to other opportunities just because they had already invested in one.”</p>
<p>“‘At some point the word ’strategy’ becomes a euphemism for procrastination. A lot of different plans, a lot of different plans, and they will take a long time and you never —’ and there he cut himself off as he so often does. So I’ll finish it for him. You would never end up going to the <em>trial</em>.”</p>
<p>“[Peter Drucker said] ‘<em>culture eats strategy</em>’… It doesn’t matter how great your plan is, it doesn’t matter who your people are, if what binds them together is weak or toxic, so, too, will be the outcome — if you even get that far. But if the ties that bind you together are strong, if you have a sense of purpose and mission, you can withstand great trials.”</p>
<p>“To maintain loyalty and faith among conspirators… ‘it must be indeed that the hatred is great or that your authority is <em>very</em> great.’”</p>
<p>“Churchill once compared an offensive force to throwing a bucket of water over the floor: ‘It rushes forward, then soaks forward, and finally stops altogether until another bucket can be brought.’ It’s the moment <em>in between those buckets</em> when a conspiracy is most vulnerable, because the combination of stasis and exposure begins to evaporate those ties that bind. But even more than that, it is here that one has the brief time to reflex and consider: <em>Is it worth another try? Do I have it in me?</em>”</p>
<p>“Machiavelli: ‘Anyone who is threatened and is forced by necessity either to act or to suffer becomes a very dangerous man to the prince.’”</p>
<p>“‘The terrible thing about people like you is that decent people have to become so much like you in order to stop you — in order to survive.’”</p>
<p>“Perfect is the enemy of good. Clausewitz warned generals about the ‘culiminating point of victory.’ A point where, if blindly ridden past, flush with the momentum of winning and strength, you <em>imperil everything you have achieved</em>. The deision to attack one additional city, to charge after the enemy who has retreated, or to extend the battle for one more day might not just be subject to diminishing returns, it might <em>snatch defeats from the jaws of victory</em>.”</p>
<p>“Cunning and resources might win the war, but it’s the stories and the myths <em>afterward</em> that will determine who <em>deserved</em> to win it. How one rides out the chaos in the aftermath of a deed is <em>everything</em>. Winning, succeeding, pulling off the complex operation is the last step of one journey but simultaneously the first step in the next one, one arguably more important and difficult than what came before. The next step is <em>holding on to the victory</em>. No matter how brilliant you are, how impressive the conspiracy was — it will be defined by what comes after.”</p>
<p>“Violence is reciprocal and imitative. It escalates in a never-ending cycle, often taking society with it.”</p>
<p>“Of the dangers after a successful conspiracy, Machiavelli would say, ‘there is only one, and that is when someone is left who may avenge the dead prince…’ After David fells Goliath with his well-placed stone, that’s not the end of it. Then began the gruesome work of hacking off the giant’s head.”</p>
<p>“Without a way out, tensions only increase and combatants have no choice but to fight on. Scipio Africanus, the general who defeated Hannibal, would say that an army should not only leave the road for their enemy to retreat by they should <em>pave</em> it. The Romans had a name for this road, the Gallic Way.”</p>
<p>“What, if anything, would come as a surprise? His own power and strength for one… Reality seems, somehow, more malleable than it did before.”</p>
<p>“[What is the relation between Thiel’s involvement in destroying Gawker and his endorsement of Trump?] One is a conspiracy, the other a crime of opportunity.”</p>
<p>“I would ask Mr. A… what he made of it all. He would smile and tell him, ‘I don’t care about politics, I only care that my friends are in power.’”</p>
<p>“It became clear to me that a referendum on the merits of a specific conspiracy would be somewhat pointless… I decided not to make a final statement but chose instead to deal in tactics. I rounded no rough edges and I’ll leave it to other experts to sort through exactly what the implications of this case are.”</p>
<p>“What would the world look like if more people tried to change things, <em>conspired</em> to change things they found unjust, unfair, immoral?”</p>
