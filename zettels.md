# Zettels Master List

IDs follow a 53-alphabet numbering system: 
$\emptyset$ < A < ... < Z < a < ... < z < AA < ... AZ < Aa < ... < Az < BA < ...

We can also add decimals in between "whole numbers."

There's a Github-style heatmap at the bottom tracking my daily zettel creation.

	 of the table column. |:-|:--| mean the first column is 1/3 total width 
	 while second column is 2/3 total width.)
