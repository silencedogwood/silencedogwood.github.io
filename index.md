Don't give up because of adversity.
::: 

*Everyone* feels like giving up at some point. Just know I am not unique in 
this: to doubt is certainly human, but to overcome doubt is hard for everyone.

Decide what and how much you want and stick to it. 
:::

Greed! I've been working on a way to make money on the side. It's going well, 
but today I've been doing a lot of reading on how to expand the business and 
other traditional start-up musings. 

What a waste of time! Income and status are the most basic ways to measure 
myself against others, and it is so damn easy to waste an entire lifetime 
optimizing these personal metrics. 

Look upon these desires and *see* their ugliness. I started this business as a 
way to make *passive income*, so I could focus my time and energy on my other, 
infinitely more important goal of attaining immortality. How foolish it would 
be to fail before even starting, on the venture that was born to grant me 
freedom from money and status in the first place!

Volunteer regularly. 
:::

I'll need to figure out how often I want to do this, but it's got to be 
regular. I need to volunteer, for purely selfish reasons: it makes me feel 
good and ensures I don't accidently become really lonely. 

Volunteering on celebratory occasions might be better than partying: it would 
make me feel much better. Volunteering with friends is even more fun.

Don't misunderstand the sunk-cost fallacy.
:::

I’ll need to silence the sunk cost fallacy to make this work. Actually maybe 
this is the correct way to approach the fallacy. I thought it meant to just 
constantly think about whether something was worth doing. But that’s a huge 
drain on my resources and I’m not good at reasoning in probabilities yet. So I 
think “Ugh this isn’t going to succeed, it’s not worth it” even though I 
haven’t received any new information. It’s just me going back and forth. This 
project might be a deadend, but I should only let myself reconsider at certain 
intervals. Not just willy-nilly. I work for 1 month and then reconsider. And 
by reconsider, I should set up criteria that make me keep going or give up. 
That way I don’t just do bad work and be ineffective until the deadline.

Drop everything but one thing and get plenty of sleep if overwhelmed.

Stuck on the app and physics, but I'm getting sad after messing up physics so 
much.
