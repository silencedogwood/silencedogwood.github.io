**Naive absolutes.**

What was most striking to me was Kipling's way of effortlessly explaining the 
shortcomings of absolutes. Endorsing absolutes is easy to communicate; nuance 
is harder to do well succinctly. Some of it is logical: "make allowance for 
their doubting too" says believing in yourself doesn't mean lying to yourself. 
Don't forget that other people also have valuable experience behind their 
predictions. Some of it is politics from experience: "and yet don't look too 
good, not talk too wise" is the first level *above* publicly being an idiot and 
publicly trying to look smart. Most people probably recognize the truth in it, 
but there isn't really an advantage to *not trying* to look good or sound smart
so people don't do it. 

There's no really unique content in the poem. The cautions are all things I've 
seen played out in movies or books. And yet they're almost certainly things I'm 
going to fail at responding to in my life.
