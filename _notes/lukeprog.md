From [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oi873FWi6pHWxswSa), "How to Beat Procrastination", "My Algorithm for Beating Procrastination", and "How to be Happy" are the ones I should read closely. I also need to follow up on the sources. 

Lukeprog recommends *The Procrastination Equation* by Piers Steel, so I think I'll read that and include lukeprog's ideas too. Something I need to keep thinking about is lukeprog's equation: $$ Motivation = \frac{Expectancy \times Value}{Impulsiveness \times Delay} $$
