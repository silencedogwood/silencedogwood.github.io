**Learning from Harry.** 

**Modelling others.**

"When we look at others we see personality traits that explain their behavior, but when we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our behavior... the fundamental attribution error is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits what would be better explained by circumstance and context." - p30 

"Well, yes," Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn't feeling angrier at Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to be overriding that, for now. "The more you try to justify yourself to people like that, the more it acknowledges that they have the right to question you. It shows you think they get to be your inquisitor, and once you grant someone that sort of power over you, they just push more and more." This was one of Draco Malfoy's lessons which Harry had thought was actually pretty smart: people who tried to defend themselves got questioned over every little point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if you made it clear from the start that you were a celebrity and above social conventions, people's minds wouldn't bother tracking most violations. "That's why when Ron came over to me as I was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay away from you, I held my hand out over the floor and said, 'You see how high I'm holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this high to talk to me.' Then he accused me of, quote, sucking you into the darkness, unquote, so I pursed my lips and went schluuuuurp, and after that his mouth was still making those talking noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don't think he'll be trying his lectures on me again." - Ch 48 idk what page

"Your brain, by sheer Pavlovian association, links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic criminals with unbelievable excuses. You don't have to consider the specific details, your brain just pattern-matches the hypothesis into a bucket of things you don't believe, and you're done... Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory Charms is *low-status*." -p1291

> "Philip Tetlock's experiments on people asked to trade off a sacred value for a secular one, like a hospital administrator who has to choose between spending a million dollars on a liver to save a five-year-old, and spending the million dollars to buy other hospital equipment or pay physician salaries. And the subjects became indignant and wanted to punish the administrator for even thinking about the choice... you thought that was stupid, since if hospital equipment and doctor salaries didn't also save lives, there would be no point in having hospitals or doctors." -p1337 

"Believing men would act in their own interest was not cynicism, it turned out, but sheerest optimism; in reality men do not meet so high a standard." - p1369

"Somewhere in his mind he was moving through an empty room filled with mechanical puppies by whose meaningless lip-moving noises he'd been *distracted* -" - p1483 

"That's not how responsibility works, Professor... when you do fault analysis, there's no point in assigning fault to a part you can't change afterward, it's like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn't going to change next time. There's no point in allocating responsibility to people who aren't going to alter their actions. You realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you're the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there. That's why Dumbledore has his room full of broken wands." - 1503 

"Not that I should've tried asking for help from normal people, of couse, and I will change and be less stupid next time." - p1504 

"Normal people don't choose on the basis of consequences, they just play roles. There's a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll roaming the hallways. The little picture of Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can't learn from experience or change herself, so there isn't any point to this conversation. People like you aren't responsible for anything, people like me are, and when we fail there's no one else to blame." -1505 

**Success.** 

"The one thing you absolutely needed to achieve greatness... an important problem" - p41 

"So replan! Don't let your life be steered by your reluctance to do a little extra thinking. You *know* that." - p125 Sorting Hat 

"Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me. I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would sacrifice my potential." - p125 

"The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly have said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it and found some more socially palatable arguments to the same conclusion - 'you think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet lived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely to take up your wand if you lay it down.' 'Well... yeah, frankly. I don't usually come out and say it like that, but yeah'" - p127 

"I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I... fail... 'What happens if you fail?' I don't know! 'Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?' There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's mind. 'You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in some quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly *what* you aren't thinking - you *know* that by far the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies...'" - p128

"For although you are ambitious, you have no ambition... I expect you will grasp at any opportunity for advancement which falls into your hands. But there is no great ambition that you are driven to accomplish, and you will not *make* your opportunities. At best, you will grasp your way upward into Minister of Magic, or some other high-position of unimportance, never breaking the bounds of your existence." - 1073

"Harry had read once, somewhere, that the opposite of happiness wasn't sadness, 
but boredom; and the author had gone on to say that to find happiness in life 
you asked yourself not what would make you happy, but what would excite 
you." - p 1653

**Nihil supernum.**

In Chapter 8, Harry predicts he'll have to convince Hermione he's smart so he gives her the drink that makes you spit it out before she asks him to prove he's smart and then claims to clean the mess by snapping his fingers. 

"No matter what, it's always your fault. Even if you tell McGonagall, she's not responsible for what happens, you are. Following the school rules isn't an excuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying your best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've got to get the job done no matter what." - p1177 

"Even if it's sad, I think that's part of the environment that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who don't have anyone else to shove final responsibility onto, and that's why they form the mental habit of tracking everything themselves." - p1179 

**Roles.**

"Because that's part of the role of someone playing a concerned adult - you'd never change your actions, you wouldn't actually behave differently, because of anything I said." - p61

"On the other hand, it is less improbable that a young child would imagine this as the *role to play* in order to convince his teacher and classmates that he is not the next Dark Lord. The import of an act lies not in what that act *resembles on the surface*, Mr. Potter, but in the states of mind which make that act more or less probable." - p307 

"The Transfiguration Professor is reading from a script, Mr. Potter! That script calls for her to mourn and grieve, that all may know how much she cared." - p1570 

**Rationalizing.**

Harry plays a game where he creates a rule and Hermione asks him if any triplet satisfies the rule. She asks 4-6-8, 10-12-14, 1-3-5, -3--1-1, then guesses the rule is the numbers needs to increase by 2 every time. Then Harry tells her that only 20% of grownups get it right. Now she asks 2-5-8, 10-20-30, and guesses that the numbers have to increase by the same amount each time. The rule was "three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to highest." - p107 

**Controlling yourself.**

"When a Hogwarts professor challenged you, you did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed your claws, heedless of the danger. You escalated, and then you escalated again... The fact that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot." - p292 

"When there's a confusing problem and you're just starting out and you have a falsifiable hypothesis, go test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do it right away. Don't worry about designing an elaborate course of experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a funding agency. Just check *as fast as possible* whether your ideas are false before you start investing huge amounts of effort in them." - p350

**Trying.**

"You never called any question impossible until you had taken an actual clock and thought about it for five minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not five minutes metaphorically, five minutes by the physical clock." - p415 

"Suppose we try to condition on the fact that we win this, or at least get out of this alive. If someone TOLD YOU AS A FACT that you had survived, or even won, somehow made everything turn out okay, what would you think had happened?" - 1785 

"More than a hundred horcruxes. That had been *insane*, there wasn't any other word for it, a sign of Voldemort's damaged thinking about death. A Muggle security expert would have called it fence-post security, like building a fence-post over a hundred metres high in the middle of the desert. Only a very obliging attacker would try to climb the fence-post. Anyone sensible would just walk around the fence-post, and making the fence-post even higher wouldn't stop that. Once you forgot to be scared of *how impossible the problem was supposed to be*, it wasn't even difficult." - 1825 

**Truth.**

"Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. If you're equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge... they didn't notice how confused they were, and that meant they couldn't be more confused by falsehood than by truth." - p431 

"Just as the fundamental question of rationality is 'What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?', there's also a cardinal sin... they didn't ask themselves if they had evidence which discriminated *that* possibility from all the *other* possibilities you could imagine, evidence they'd be very unlikely to encounter if the *wasn't* true" - p629 

"Spending money to save a life establishes a lower bound on the monetary value of that life. Refusing establishes an upper bound. If the upper and lower bounds are inconsistent, you could move money from one place to another and save more lives at the same cost... How very hollow the indignation of those who refuse to say that money and life can ever be compared, when all they're doing is forbidding the strategy that saves the most people, for the sake of pretentious moral grandstanding..." - p1337-1338 

"What people really believe doesn't feel like a belief, it feels like the way the world is." - p1363

"the existence of brain damage implied that there were no such things as souls." - p1405

"The point of a subjective Bayesian calculation wasn't that, after you made up a bunch of numbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right answer. The real point was that the process of making up numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh all the relative probabilities... One version of the process was to tally hypotheses and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation, and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain's gut feeling *after* you'd forced it to really *weigh* everything." - p1441

"'Why does any kind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark 
of maturity, of sophistication, like you've seen everything and you know 
better. Or because putting something down feels like pushing yourself up. Or 
they don't have a phoenix themselves, so their political instinct tells them 
there's no advantage to be gained from saying nice things about phoenixes. 
Or because being cynical feels like knowing a secret truth that common people 
don't know... I think maybe that's what *he's* getting wrong -- that he's 
cynical about everything else, but not about cynicism itself.'" - Ch 65

This reminded me of PG's [Early Work](http://paulgraham.com/early.html):

This idea of being cynical to signal maturity or intellect is something I 
catch myself doing often...

**Modelling yourself.**

"I'm voting that this is a performance, said Inner Critic. She wouldn't just blurt all that out in response to one question unless she was looking for an opportunity. / Noted but I'm putting a low weight of confidence on that, said Ravenclaw. It's very hard not to let your suspicions control your perceptions when you're trying to weigh evidence that subtle." - p916 

"Note, said Ravenclaw One, we had already thought of that argument so we can't use it to shift belief again each time we rehearse it." - 1408

"If you didn't *predict* that something would happen, if it took you completely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when you *didn't* see it coming, isn't enough to explain." - p1413

" 'Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind's running in all different directions?' she managed. 'My own approach is usually to identify the different desires, give them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco, Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad, Mum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter.' " - p1491. 

"But there is another possible explanation, Mr. Potter. It is that people play the role of friendship. They do just as much as that role requires of them, and no more. The thought occurs to me that perhaps the difference between you and them is not that you care more than they do. Why would you have been born with such unusually strong emotions of friendship, that you alone among wizardkind are driven to resurrect Hermione Granger after her death? No, the most likely difference is not that you care more. It is that, being a more logical creature than they, you alone have thought that playing the role of Friend would require this of you." - Ch 95

"Ruminating about the past can contribute to depression. You have *my* blanket permission to just never think about your past, ever." Similar to putanumonit's post on COVID. - 1892

**Perspective.**

"Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's children's children, 
the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from star to star? No. Of 
course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances, paling into nothingness 
in the light of that promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. 
You had to put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and 
unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be remembered 
someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive, if you were one of the 
tiny handful of sentient beings born into the beginning of all things, before 
intelligent life had come fully into its power. That the much vaster future 
depended on what you did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, where there 
was still so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like 
Dementors." - Ch45

"Adults don't respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they 
did, they wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as well read 
something Richard Feynman wrote instead." - 53
