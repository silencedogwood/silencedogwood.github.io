"The eight major advantages of the Standardized Meal System. 

1. No need to accumulate recipe books. 
2. Standard shopping list - hence very efficient shopping. 
3. Almost zero waste - nothing in the refrigerator or pantry unless required for one of the recipes. 
4. Diet planned and nutritionally balanced in advance. 
5. No time wasted wondering what to cook. 
6. No mistakes, no unpleasant surprised. 
7. Excellent food, superior to most restaurants at a much lower price (point 3). 
8. Minimal cognitive load required. "
