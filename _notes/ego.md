I think of self-help books as void of content. Still they tend to make me feel 
more inspired and energetic. This book was especially inspiring, probably 
because I have a pretty big ego. 

Humility is taking one step after another instead of allowing yourself to 
fantasize about the glory of the victory. 

A corollary of the idea that when we discuss and fantasize about our plans 
with others, we tend to lose motivation for actually achieving them: when I 
buy textbooks, I lose motivation to read them; I actually feel *okay* with not 
reading them, which means I'm actually content with showing off that I know 
something to other people instead of actually knowing the material. 
That, or I feel that with the book so close, I can read it later, whenever I 
really want to. 

I notice when I'm thinking about reading a textbook, I often decide to read 
something else, often labelling that thing as a prerequisite, then put off 
reading that other thing. I literally count procrastinating on reading as work 
for the day, without noticing it. 

## Highlighted Notes 

"The ability to evaluate one's own ability is the most important skill of all. 
Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult 
every step of the way." - p29 

"Practice seeing yourself with a little distance, cultivating the ability 
*to get out of your own head*. Detachment is a natural ego antidote. It's easy 
to be emotionally invested and *infatuated* with your own work. What is rare is 
not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and 
self-awareness." - p29 

"Though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we 
seek. Because we're action-focused, our ambition will be not grandiose but 
iterative." - p29

"Valuable endeavors we undertake are difficult, but talking is always easy." - 
p31

"Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe a better 
reason will pop into your head." - p32 

"While goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins 
to confuse it with actual progress. The same for verbalization. Even talking 
to ourselves while we work decreases insight and breakthroughs." -p32 

"Passion is *about*. (I am passionate about x.) Purpose is *to* and *for*. 
(I must do x. I am willing to endure y to accomplish x.) Purpose is about 
pursuing something outside yourself instead of pleasuring yourself." - p47 

"More than purpose, we need realism. Where do we start? What do we do first? 
What do we do right now?" - p47 

"Attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and 
subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneosuly." - p51

"If he wanted to give his coach feedback or question a decision, he needed to 
do it in private and self-effacingly so as not to offend his superior. He 
learned to be a rising star without threatening." - p52 

"Greatness comes from humble beginnings. It means you're the least important 
person in the room -- until you change that with results." - p52 

"Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be 'respected,' you can forget 
credit. You can forget it so hard that you're *glad* when others get it instead 
of you -- that was your aim, after all." - p52 

Notice how many great people seem to do this. The apprenticeship model is 
wildly successful. 

"It's not about kissing ass. It's not about making someone else *look* good. 
It's about providing support so that others can *be* good. In other words, 
find canvases for other people to paint on. Clear the path for the people 
above you and you will create a path for yourself." - p50 

"Starting out, understand the following are true: you're not as good or as 
important as you think you are, you have an attitude that needs to be 
readjusted, and most of what you think you know is wrong." - p50 

"This reduces your ego at a critical time in your career, letting you absorb 
everything you can without the obstructions that block others' vision and 
progress" - p51

"Franklin wrote the Silence Dogood letters, submitted them by sliding them 
under the print-shop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until 
much later in his life. Franklin was learning how public opinion worked, 
generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and 
wit. It was a strategy he used time and again over his career -- once even 
publishing in his competitor's paper -- for Franklin saw the constant benefit in 
making other people look good and letting them take credit for your ideas." - 
p51 

Ideas for canvas strategy: 
#. come up with ideas to hand to your boss 
#. find people and introduce them to each other 
#. find what nobody else wants to do and do it 
#. find inefficiencies and waste and fix them 
#. produce more than anyone else and give your ideas away 
" - p53 

"You may find that there's no reason to ever stop doing ths, even once you've 
graduated to heading your own thing. Let it become natural and permanent; let 
others apply it to you while you're too busy applying it to those above you. 
If you pick up this mantle once, you'll see what most people's egos prevent 
them from appreciating: the person who clears the path utimately controls its 
direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting." - p53 

"'A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, 
so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.' - Alan 
Watts" - p58 

"'Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first call promising' - Cyril 
Connolly" - p63 

"Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. 
Our ability to learn is dulled by pride. This tends to happen early or in the 
process -- when we're flushed with beginner's conceit." - p64 

"John D. Rockefeller, as a young man, practiced a nightly conversation with 
himself. 'Because you have got a start,' he'd say aloud or write in his diary, 
'you think you are quite the merchant; look out or you will lose your head - 
go stead.'" - p64 

"Night after night he asked himself, 'Are you going to be a fool? Are you going 
to let this money puff you up? Keep your eyes open, don't lose your balance.'" - 
p65 

"The question to ask, when you feel pride, is this: What am I missing right 
now that a more humble person might see?" - p66 

"Just because you are quiet doesn't mean you are without pride. Privately 
thinking you're better than others is still pride. It's still dangerous." - p66 

"Sure, you get it. You know that all things require work and that work might be 
quite difficult. But do you *really* understand? Do you have any idea just how 
much work there is going to be? Not work until you get your big break, not work 
until you make a name for yourself, but work, work, work, forever and ever." - 
p68 

"*Fac, si facis.* (Do it if you're going to do it.)" - p69 

"*Materiam superabat opus.* (The workmanship was better than the material.) - 
p69 

"Face life and proceed with quiet confidence in spite of the distractions. Let 
others grasp at crutches. It will be a lonely fight to be real, to say "I'm not 
going to take the edge off.' To say, 'I'm going to be myself, the best version 
of that self. I am in this for the long game, no matter how brutal it might be.' 
To *do*, not *be*." - p72 

"'Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him.' - 
Ralph Waldo Emerson" - p81 

"'Humility engenders learning because it beats back the arrogance that puts 
blinders on. It leaves you open for truths to reveal themselves. You don't 
stand in your own way... Do you know how you can tell when someone is truly 
humble? ... they consistently observe and listen, the humble improve. They 
don't assume, 'I know the way.''" - p83 

"If you're not still learning, you're already dying." - p83 

"It's not enough simply to want to learn. As people progress, they must also 
understand *how* they learn and then set up processes to facilitate this 
continued education. Otherwise, we are dooming ourselves to a sort of 
self-imposed ignorance." - p84 

"We want to believe that those with great empires *set out* to build one. Why? 
So we can indulge in the pleasurable planning of ours. So we can take full 
credit for the good that happens and the riches and respect that come our 
way." - p86 

"Competitiveness drives the markets and is behind some of mankind's most 
impressive accomplishments. On an individual level, however, it is *crucial* 
that you know *who* you're competing with and *why*, that you have a clear 
sense of the space you're in." - p92 

"'One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that 
one's work is terribly important.' - Bertrand Russell" - p94. 

"What we've accomplished often required feats of raw power and force of will. 
Entrepreneurship required the creation of something where nothing existed 
before. Achieving success involved ignoring the doubts and reservations of 
the people around us. It meant rejecting rejection. When it works, these 
tendencies can feel like they've been vindicated." - p95 

"Early on in our careers, we may be able to make these sacrifices more easily. 
We can drop out of a prestigious college to start our own company. Or we can 
tolerate being looked over once in a while." - p103 

"As his wife later observed, the people who saw George Marshall as simply 
modest of quiet missed what was special about the man. He had the same traits 
that everyone has -- ego, self-interest, pride, dignity, ambition -- but they 
were 'tempered by a sense of humility and selflessness.'" - p105

"'It requires a strong constitution to withstand repeated attacks of 
prosperity.' - James Basford." - p113 

"If you want to live happy, live hidden. That means the rest of us are deprived 
of really good examples. We're lucky to see someone like Merkel in the public 
eye because she is the representative of a very large, silent majority." - p113. 

"Failure might happen tomorrow, it might happen 25 years from now. It could 
last 2 minutes or 10 years. We know everyone experiences failure and adversity, 
that means we're all subject to the rules of *gravity* and *averages*. It means 
we'll face them too. Humble and strong people don't have the same trouble with 
these troubles that egotists do. There are fewer complaints and far less 
self-immolation. Instead there's a stoic -- even cheerful -- resilience. Pity 
isn't necessary. Their identity isn't threatened. They can get by without 
constant validation." - p126 

"There are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when we are passive and 
waiting, and alive time, when we are learning and acting and utilizing every 
second." - p128 

"Malcolm X *chose* alive time. He explored religion, taught himself to read by 
checking out a pencil and a dictionary from the prison library and *copied it 
down longhand* from cover to cover. Prison was his college. This is common in 
history. Many figures took seemingly terrible situations -- a prison sentence, 
an exile, an economic depression, a military conscription, even being sent to 
a concentration camp -- and through their attitude and approach, turned those 
circumstances into fuel for their unique greatness." - p128

"In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even 
perfectly. Yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, 
jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. Depending on what 
motivates us, this response can be crushing. If ego holds sway, we'll accept 
nothing less than full appreciation." - p131 

"It's far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less 
attached we are to *outcomes* the better. When fulfilling our *own* standards 
is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort -- not the results, 
good or bad -- is enough." - p132 

"Maybe your parents will never be impressed. Maybe your girlfriend won't care. 
Maybe the investor won't see the numbers. Maybe the audience won't clap. But we 
have to be able to push through. We can't let *that* be what motivates us." - 
p132 

"How do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? 
John Wooden's advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. 
'Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in 
knowing you made the *effort* to do your best to become the best that you are 
capable of becoming.' 'Ambition,' Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, 'means 
tying your well-being to what other people say or do... Sanity means tying it 
to your own actions.'" - p133 

"'We cannot be humble except by enduring humiliations.' - Reverend William A. 
Sutton." - p135 

"Hemingway wrote, 'The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at 
the broken places. But those that will not break it kills.'" - p136 

"Alexander Hamilton wrote a friend in serious financial and legal trouble, 'Act 
with *fortitude* and *honor*. If you cannot reasonably hope for a favorable 
extrication, do not plunge deeper. Have the *courage* to make a full stop." - 
p140 

"Most trouble is temporary... unless you make that not so. Recovery is not 
grand, it's one step in front of the other. Unless your cure is more of the 
disease." - p141 

"'I never look back, except to find out about mistakes... I only see danger in 
thinking back about things you are proud of.' - Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann" - 
p143 

"It's not that great people find failure in every success. They just hold 
themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be 
objective success. Because of that, they don't much care what other people 
think; they care whether they meet their own standards. This isn't necessarily 
fun, by the way. It can feel like self-inflicted 
torture sometimes. But it does force you to always keep going, and always 
improve." - p144

"Your potential, the absolute best you're capable of - that's the metric to 
measure yourself against. Your standards are. Winning is not enough. People can 
get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win. But not 
everyone is the best possible version of themselves." - p144 

"It is no easy task to go head-to-head with one's ego. To accept first that ego 
may be there. Then to subject it to scrutiny and criticism. Most of us can't 
handle uncomfortable self-examination. Some of the world's most unbelievable 
accomplishments are undoubtedly a result of a desire to avoid facing the 
darkness of ego." - p154 

"Training is like sweeping the floor. Just because we've done it once, doesn't 
mean the floor is clean forever. Every day the dust comes back. Every day we 
must sweep." - p154 

"There's a quote from Bismarck that says, in effect, any fool can learn from 
experience. The trick is to learn from *other people's* experience." - p157 

"It's admirable to want to be better businessmen, better athletes, better 
conquerors. But no less impressive an accomplishment: being better people, 
being happier people, being balanced people, being content people, being humble 
and selfless people. What is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting 
the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the 
other way around." - p157
