"I think few people realize exactly what a failure all this *theoretical* work on 
the genetic code turned out to be." - p15 

"The most important theme of the book is natural selection. As I explain, it is 
this basic mechanism that makes biology different from all other sciences... 
Anyone can grasp the mechnism itself, though remarkably few people actually do 
so." - p 16 

"Natural selection almost always builds on what went before, so that a basically 
simple process becomes encumbered with many subsidiary gadgets... It is the 
resulting complexity that makes biological organisms so hard to unscramble. 
Biology is thus very different from physics. The basic laws of physics can 
usually be expressed in exact mathematical form, and they are probably the same 
throughout the universe." - p 16 

"All this can make it difficult for a physicist to contribute to biological 
research. Elegance and a deep simplicity are useful guides in physics, but in 
biology such intellectual tools can be very misleading." - p 16 

"I myself knew very little biology till I was over thirty, since my first 
degree was in physics. It took me a little time to adjust to the rather different 
way of thinking necessary in biology. It was almost as if one had to be born 
again. Yet such a transition is not as difficult as all that and is certainly 
well worth the effort." - p 16 

## Childhood 

"If I had a fault, it was that if I could grasp something easily, I believed I 
had already understood it thoroughly." - p 19 

"I have no doubt, as will emerge later, that this loss of faith in Christian 
religion and my growing attachment to science have played a dominant part in 
my scientific career, not so much on a day-to-day basis but in the choice of 
what I have considered interesting and important... What could be more foolish 
than to base one's entire view of life on ideas that, however plausible at the 
time, now appear to be quite erroneous?" - p 20 

"Much later, when I read Linus Pauling's *General Chemistry*, I found it 
enthralling. Even so I have never tried to master inorganic chemistry, and my 
knowledge of organic chemistry is still very patchy." - p 21 

"Andrade put me onto the dullest problem imaginable, the determination of the 
viscosity of water, under pressure, between 100 and 150 degrees C... What I 
*had* acquired, however indirectly, was the hubris of the physicist, the feeling 
that physics as a discipline was highly successful, so why should not other 
sciences do likewise? I believe this did help me when, after the war, I 
eventually switched to biophysics." - p 22 

## Career 

"Only gradually did I realize that this lack of qualification could be an 
advantage. By the time most scientists have reached age thirty they are trapped 
by their own expertise. They have invested so much effort in one particular 
field that it is often extremely difficult, at that time in their careers, to 
make a radical change." - p 24

"I had discovered the gossip test - what you are really interested in is what 
you gossip about." - p 25 

"The main advantage was that the work was not too demanding and left me plenty 
of time for extensive reading in my new subject." - p 30 

"Many proteins, if heated briefly to the boiling point of water, became 
denatured, as if they had unfolded so that their three-dimensional structure 
had been partly destroyed. When this happened the denatured protein usually lost 
its catalytic or other function, strongly suggesting that the function of such 
a protein *depended on its exact three-dimensional structure*." - p 52 

"As a beginner in research, still almost an amateur... I think at the back of 
my mind was the idea that science was an occupation for gentlemen. Incredible 
as it may seem, I had not realized that for many it was a highly competitive 
career." - p 63

"The existing textbooks usually used a step-by-step method, based largely on 
Bragg's law and the historical development of the subject. To someone like 
myself this only made it more difficult and certainly more tedious, since an 
elementary method often arouses deeper questions in the learner and these 
worries can impede one's progress in learning. It is often better, at least 
for brighter pupils, to go straight to the advanced treatment and try to get 
over the more powerful formalism while at the same time attempting to provide 
some insight into what is going on." - p 65 

"Meanwhile Bragg had independently thought about it. Whereas I had gotten bogged 
down, he made rapid progress. He boldly assumed that one could approximate the 
shape by an ellipsoid -- a particularly simple type of distorted sphere. Then 
he looked at what little was known of the crystals of hemoglobin of other 
species of animal, on the assumption that all types of hemoglobin molecules 
were likely to have about the same shape. Moreover, he was not disturbed if the 
data did not *exactly* fit his model, since it was unllikely that the molecule 
was *exactly* an ellipsoid. In otherwords, he made bold, simplifying assumptions;
looked at as wide a range of data as possible; and was critical but not 
pernickety, as I had been, about the fit between his model and experimental 
facts. He arrived at a shape that we now know is not a bad approximation to the 
molecule's real shape... The result was not of first-class importance, if only 
because the method was indirect and needed confirmation by more direct methods, 
but it was a revelation to me as to how to do scientific research." - p 67 

"There was some justification for his annoyance. A group of people engaged in 
a difficult and somewhat uncertain undertaking are not helped by persistent 
negative criticism from one of their number. It destroys the mood of confidence 
necessary to carry through such a hazardous enterprise to a successful 
conclusion. But equally it is useless to persist in a course of action that is 
bound to fail, especially if alternate methods exist." - p 71

"It is interesting to note the curious mental attitude of scientists working on 
'hopeless' subjects. Contrary to what one might at first expect, they are all 
buoyed up with irrepressible optimism. I believe there is a simple explanation 
for this. Anyone without such optimism simply leaves the field and takes up 
some other line of work. Only the optimists remain. So one has the curious 
phenomenon that workers in subjects in which the prize is big but the prospects 
of success very small always appear very optimistic. And this in spite of the 
fact that, although plenty appears to be going on, they never seem to get 
appreciably nearer their goal." - p 72 

"Sir Lawrence Bragg was one of those scientists with a boyish enthusiasm for 
research, which he never lost. He was also a keen gardener. When he moved in 
1954 from his large house and garden in West Road, Cambridge, to London, to head 
the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street, he lived in the official apartment 
at the top of the building. Missing his garden, he arranged that for one 
afternoon each week he would hire himself out as a gardener to an unknown lady 
living in The Boltons, a select inner-London suburb. He respectfully tipped his 
hat to her and told her his name was Willie. For several months all went well 
till one day a visitor glancing out of the window, said to her hostess, 'My dear, 
what *is* Sir Lawrence Bragg doing in your garden?' I can think of few other 
scientists of his distinction who would do something like this." - p 74 

"Bragg had a great gift for seeing problems in simple terms, realizing that 
many apparent complications fall away if the basic underlying pattern could be 
discovered. It was thus not surprising that in 1950 he wanted to show that at 
least some stretches of the polypeptide chain in a protein folded up in a 
simple manner." - p 74

"DNA is, at bottom, a much less sophisticated molecule than a highly evolved 
protein and for this reason reveals its secret more easily. We were not to know 
this in advance - it was just good luck that we stumbled onto such a beautiful 
structue." - p 83

"I believe there is a good reason for the simplicity of the nucleic acids. They 
probably go back to the origin of life, or at least very close to it. At that 
time mechanisms had to be fairly simple or life could not have started. Of 
course the very existence of cehmical molecules can only be explained by quantum 
mechanics, but fortunately the shape of a chemical molecule can be embodied 
rather easily in a mechanical model, and it is this that makes the ideas easy 
to understand." - p 86

"But it was not all due to competitiveness. It was because we passionately 
wnated to know the details of the structure. This, then, was a powerful force 
in our favor. I believe there were at least two others. Neither Jim not I felt 
any external pressure to get on with the problem. This meant that we could 
approach it intensively for a period and then leave it alone for a bit. Our 
other advantage was that we had evolved unstated by fruitful methods of 
collaboration... If either of us suggested a new idea the other, while 
taking it seriously, would  attempt to demolish it in a candid but nonhostile 
manner. This turned out to be quite crucial. In solving scientific problems of 
this type, it is almost impossible to avoid falling into error... to obtain 
the correct solution of a problem, unless it is transparently easy, usually 
requires a *sequence* of logical steps. If one of these is a mistake, the 
answer is often hidden, since the error usually puts one on completely the 
wrong track. It is therefore extremely important not to be trapped by one's 
mistaken ideas." - p 94
