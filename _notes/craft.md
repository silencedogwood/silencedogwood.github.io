There are more videos in this lecture series. I just watched the first one. 
Some things I learned: 
- rereading is the first indication you're reading something in a way it wasn't 
written
- Go through papers in a field and circle the words that make them seem 
important. Fields have different "important words" lists. Whenever you write, 
see if you can find a bunch in your own writing; if not, sprinkle some in from 
the list. 
- New or original knowledge doesn't matter. It must be *valuable*. 
- Writing isn't meant to be preserved forever. Think of knowledge not as a 
monotonically increasing function but as a temporal instance of what people 
think is important. Writing is important insofar as it moves that temporal 
instance forward.
