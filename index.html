  <p><strong><em>Thesis: If you avoid failing predictably, you avoid failing.</em></strong></p>
<p>Hey, I like this from Andrej Karpathy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to become expert at thing: 1. Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them <em>depth wise</em>, learning “on demand” (ie don’t learn bottom up breadth wise). 2. Teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words. 3. <strong>Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others.</strong></p>

<p>Volunteer regularly.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Need to do more research on this!</strong></p>
<p>I’ll need to figure out how often I want to do this, but it’s got to be regular. I need to volunteer, even if only for purely selfish reasons: it makes me feel good and ensures I don’t accidently become really lonely.</p>
<p>Volunteering on celebratory occasions might be better than partying: it would make me feel much better. Volunteering with friends is even more fun.</p>
<div id="rule">
<p>Decide what and how much you want and stick to it.</p>
</div>
<p>Greed! I’ve been working on a way to make money on the side. It’s going well, but today I’ve been doing a lot of reading on how to expand the business and other traditional start-up musings.</p>
<p>What a waste of time. Income and status are the most basic ways to measure myself against others, and it is so damn easy to waste an entire lifetime optimizing these personal metrics.</p>
<p>Look upon these desires and <em>see</em> their ugliness. I started this business as a way to make <em>passive income</em>, so I could focus my time and energy on my other, infinitely more important goal of attaining immortality. How foolish it would be to fail before even starting, on the venture that was born to grant me freedom from money and status in the first place!</p>
<p>Concretely, I <em>won’t</em> plan to make it big and expand past my set financial goal of $500,000. (Though I haven’t put <em>much</em> thought into that number; it’s just that 4% (which I think is a <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/">safe withdrawal rate for a mixture of stocks and US government bonds</a> and I think I can live on $20,000 a year outside of the US.) Hit this goal and focus on learning biology as much as possible.</p>

<p>Executing should be the default.</p>

<p>It took working on a larger project for about <a href="https://toggl.com/">500 hours</a> now for me to really internalize there are two ways to feel like you’re getting work done: planning and executing. This larger project is the first time time I’ve felt like executing was my default state: some of that has to do with my properly setting up Github to keep me focused on getting tasks done based on priority and with a schedule, but I also think this was the first larger project I’m having fun sticking to and growing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I realized that when planning to explore a subject, I’d create a queue of books or papers to go through, but <em>then stop, satisfied with the work I’d done</em>. Worse, after starting on the queue the next day, I’d realize the stuff was too advanced, then spend an hour skimming over more sources for a better queue of reading materials, and then <em>again</em> I’d be satisfied with my progress. Even though I’ve literally not learned anything yet.</p>
<p>I used to rationalize this by thinking it was the sunk-cost fallacy; continuing reading things that were harder to get through or relied on knowledge I didn’t have was wasting even more time, better to just restart and acknowledge I wasted the time creating my reading list. But that’s not actually how we should approach the fallacy. The correct approach is to <em>silence</em> the sunk-cost alarm bells most of the time on a hard task. Keep barreling ahead like an idiot and only reevaluate once every week or once every month. Hard work is hard; you don’t need another excuse to stop.</p>

<p><em>Uncomfortable to write so probably will be uncomfortable to read.</em></p>
<p>Sexual assault is an insanely widespread problem: <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem">1 in 6 American women and 1 in 33 American men have been victims of attempted or completed rape</a>. For a crime that can traumatize someone for life, those are very high numbers. Worse, <a href="https://cachouston.org/sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-facts/">around 70% of reported sexual assaults happen to children under 18</a>.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of celebrities being accused of rape and sexual assault is also a bit surprising to me. Celebrities have fame, economic security, typically proud and supportive spouses and children, and usually the respect of people they run into on the street. Risking it all to commit such a wrong crime is crazy.</p>
<p>The common thread between the majority of sexual assaults being committed against children and high rates of celebrity accusations seems to be power. But power is something I want, too. How can I prevent becoming another rapist? I’d like to think I know right from wrong, and assault isn’t something I’ve ever done or felt compelled to do. But I don’t think I’m unusually righteous; <a href="https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/95">why should I have been born with or learned an unusually strong moral compass?</a> I think my best bet is to remove all reliance on, expectation of, and regulation of sex. Certainly more so for masturbation and pornography: those serve only to create a normalcy of sexual gratification without a partner’s consent.</p>
<p>This doesn’t seem to be popular, aside from fringe communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/">r/NoFap</a>. Only pornography seems to be more commonly criticized. Regardless, the reason I want to abstain isn’t for health benefits; I geniunely think it’d significantly decrease my chances at becoming a rapist or having rapey thoughts.</p>

<p>Drop everything but one thing and get plenty of sleep if overwhelmed.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how hard this is to follow. The things I’m stressed about aren’t really worth stressing over, based on how I currently feel about stuff I’ve been stressed about in the past. Just calm down. Come up with a new battle plan and rest to fight another day.</p>
<div id="rule">
<p>Update quickly.</p>
</div>
<p>Stolen from <a href="http://mindingourway.com/update-from-the-suckerpunch/">Nate Soares</a>.</p>
<p>Twice recently, I felt really guilty, both times were for not putting enough effort into something. That guilt stayed with me for 2 days after each occasion. Despite lack of effort causing me to fail twice in quick succession, I haven’t thought of a general useful rule yet to prevent that from happening. But I know what I did wrong on those two specific incidents, and I notice now the mistaken beliefs that caused me to underestimate the work required. With that problem solved, <em>I should release the guilt because it has served its purpose</em>. But I don’t. I go on feeling bad about it. If I really did update my beliefs after being wrong, why should I still feel guilty? I think I might not actually believe I updated my beliefs, in which case losing the guilt would be a mistake. So how then do I test whether or not I have updated my beliefs?</p>

<p>Things don’t happen naturally, you have to <em>make</em> them happen.</p>

<p>I got turned down by a potential customer today for a completely valid reason, but it’s really make me doubt myself. It shouldn’t. I should update on the suckerpunch as fast as I can and then discard the feeling. Rejection doesn’t mean what you want won’t happen; it only means it’s not going to happen in the current situation, that the world isn’t going to hand you what you want <em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>If you really want something and you’ve been turned down, understand what’s lacking, and fill it ten times over. Show them you’re unstoppable and willing to do anything. Above all, repeat the following often:</p>
<p><strong><em>My main goal in pursuing this venture is to become determined and resilient.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Nothing happens by itself; you must make things happen.</em></strong></p>
